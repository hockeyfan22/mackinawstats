## Dale Drangus vs. Mirjam Poterbin
Drangus 160 | Poterbin 147

I absolutely just dominate and have Wonki taking slurps of my farts all day on Sunday and into Monday night. Chef Rusty drops 5 big poos on Wonki's head, and unknown star James comes up with 28 points on Thursday night. Wonks threatened late, but his beefstick went limp when it counted, and the superior team prevailed. AJ Brown didn't even try to play football this week, the second time in a row.

## BJs Chubby Hubby vs. Straight Outta Hopkin
Chubby 92 | Hopkin 149

Dev's tummy was apparently satiated with 92 points, lacking the hunger to pick up a week 3 win. Perhaps a questionable decision to play the NYG Defense against San Fran resulted in -5 points, which didn't offset the 4.5 points he got from his receivers. Josh puts up 149 with big games from Lockett/Prescott/Henry. Trubisky put up a serviceable 11 points before his ass was sat on the pine - hit up Josh with some QB trades if Garoppolo is out another week.

## DJ Play My Favorite Song vs. A Good Day to Ken Whisenhunt
DJ 79 | Whisenhunt 161

(1) Bram could have not played either of his QBs this week and still won, (2) This was the most points Zach's gotten out of his RBs this season, with an impressive 20.5 points collectively. (3) Bram's kicker scored the same points as Zach's 3 WR played this week.

## Scorekeeper Jeff vs. Tomlin's First Pump Supply
Jeff 103 | Tomlin 174

Jeff continues to spiral - with rumors now circulating that he has switched to the strawberry Charleston Chews - a sure sign of demise. It would have been a tough week to win, with Ehlinger putting up 174 as this week's high scorer. Kamara puts up 38, and Fitzmagic settled in with a 3TD week. Tough QB play for Gersh - with Tannehill and Jones putting up 20 points combined.

## Fantasy Football Team vs. Judge Jeudy
FFT 134 | Jeudy 131

Judge Jeudy? More like Judge Poopy. This was a close matchup decided by 2.6 points - Mahomes with a big 40 points on Monday night which was the ultimate decider. Should Golladay have figured in in his season debut? It's not for me to decide, but my third round pick is usually in my lineup.

## Mike Mike vs. Sa'Quads
Mike 103 | Quads 109

A relatively low scoring affair, Zach get some good luck for once (see points Matrix for Points Against), but you don't want to count on your Defense for too many weeks and even an average D/ST score would have put him in eliminator territory. But the Colts played the Jets so it was a pretty safe bet they would score 2TD.

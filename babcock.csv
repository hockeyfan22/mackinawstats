I thought Montreal played with great,10/3/2018,1
effort great structure,10/3/2018,1
I thought they worked real hard I,10/3/2018,1
thought they're above the puck I thought,10/3/2018,1
they were happy to put it in and get on,10/3/2018,1
top of us,10/3/2018,1
I thought they worked real hard to tell,10/3/2018,1
the truth I thought we got a good,10/3/2018,1
goaltending I thought they got really,10/3/2018,1
good goaltending as well we had some,10/3/2018,1
great days but in the end you know we,10/3/2018,1
won the game but we had a work way,10/3/2018,1
harder and play way better than we did,10/3/2018,1
tonight and you know what you guys can,10/3/2018,1
write all you want and tell everybody,10/3/2018,1
how great we all are but it's the,10/3/2018,1
National Hockey League and you got to,10/3/2018,1
come to work every day and if you don't,10/3/2018,1
work harder than the other team you,10/3/2018,1
don't put your work before your talent,10/3/2018,1
you don't win if you turn the puck over,10/3/2018,1
you know win so there's probably lots of,10/3/2018,1
good messages every night yeah the when,10/3/2018,1
the pucks drop you're playing a really,10/3/2018,1
good team,10/3/2018,1
it doesn't matter how many points they,10/3/2018,1
have I'm telling you they're real good,10/3/2018,1
team so I think I mentioned that this,10/3/2018,1
morning when I had to line up one out,10/3/2018,1
about the other I mentioned that same,10/3/2018,1
thing and but sometimes it doesn't,10/3/2018,1
matter what I say it's more about what,10/3/2018,1
they know after they get out there I,10/3/2018,1
thought tonight was a real good message,10/3/2018,1
and we got two points at home well I,10/3/2018,1
just think that when the other team is,10/3/2018,1
on top here and they're hungry you and,10/3/2018,1
their one or more 5050 bottles then part,10/3/2018,1
of its execution part of its work part,10/3/2018,1
of its you know if you don't come back,10/3/2018,1
and stop you flow by it's hard to,10/3/2018,1
execute so don't get me wrong I like,10/3/2018,1
winning so that's what the game whole,10/3/2018,1
game that's why he came here tonight and,10/3/2018,1
a real nice play by our guys in overtime,10/3/2018,1
and having the men we changed we were,10/3/2018,1
fresh came with speed all those things,10/3/2018,1
we scored a nice power play goal or,10/3/2018,1
penalty kill looked good we made the,10/3/2018,1
mistake therefore the goal I thought,10/3/2018,1
there was lots of good things I thought,10/3/2018,1
Lindholm was really good you know with,10/3/2018,1
that derma played well but we're way,10/3/2018,1
better than that and we expect more,10/3/2018,1
hustle,10/3/2018,1
yeah obviously and it was good gold,10/3/2018,1
liebe when ttle in that heart just,10/3/2018,1
enough to distract carry a little bit,10/3/2018,1
and he was able to make the shot yeah,10/3/2018,1
you know obviously Matthews but I think,10/3/2018,1
we can be you know I just I think we're,10/3/2018,1
better and don't want to play better and,10/3/2018,1
play right and we will and then just,10/3/2018,1
just like you guys you're learning them,10/3/2018,1
like I think you think there's a big,10/3/2018,1
carry oil from year to year there's not,10/3/2018,1
you know I've been in the league a long,10/3/2018,1
time you start all over again each and,10/3/2018,1
every year and and this is a different,10/3/2018,1
kind of team with a different set of,10/3/2018,1
expectations but yeah you know when,10/3/2018,1
you're real scared it's easy to work,10/3/2018,1
hard when you're not as scared it's not,10/3/2018,1
as easy to work hard and so hopefully,10/3/2018,1
that'll put a little scare on us and get,10/3/2018,1
going I thought I said that already I,10/3/2018,1
mean they were on top of us all the time,10/3/2018,1
so why not just get on top of them and,10/3/2018,1
then it'll be way smoother coming out of,10/3/2018,1
our own zone,10/3/2018,1
you know if they establish their game,10/3/2018,1
first and they get on top of you first,10/3/2018,1
and they're in a five-man you know,10/3/2018,1
there's no space hard to make place if,10/3/2018,1
you get on top of them and you create,10/3/2018,1
space and you start wearing a motor out,10/3/2018,1
changing them then you look pretty,10/3/2018,1
smooth so tonight we didn't look that,10/3/2018,1
smooth no we did win right see you guys,10/3/2018,1
well I just I thought you know really if,10/6/2018,2
you're gonna be one in one probably,10/6/2018,2
should've won tonight lost means,10/6/2018,2
Montreal to be honest with you we had,10/6/2018,2
tons of heavy opportunities in play but,10/6/2018,2
we had those two shifts they scored on,10/6/2018,2
one shift in the second and then we,10/6/2018,2
turned over and they scored again on the,10/6/2018,2
second shift I don't know how far they,10/6/2018,2
were apart not very far I thought that,10/6/2018,2
was a big momentum swing you know we,10/6/2018,2
didn't capitalize around their neck,10/6/2018,2
tonight like we probably could have and,10/6/2018,2
in saying that I like that we worked,10/6/2018,2
harder and we spent more time in the,10/6/2018,2
offensive zone and did some good things,10/6/2018,2
in the end we weren't polished enough to,10/6/2018,2
win so that's why you play so we just,10/6/2018,2
got to keep working at that's a good,10/6/2018,2
roll of dice when you score you know I,10/6/2018,2
didn't think we're dangerous six on five,10/6/2018,2
so we'll have to clean that up a little,10/6/2018,2
bit but you know you're you're doing,10/6/2018,2
what you can to make it happen and,10/6/2018,2
you're pushing there at that point you,10/6/2018,2
know we call the time well we had our,10/6/2018,2
players out there lots we had lots of,10/6/2018,2
opportunity we didn't do enough with it,10/6/2018,2
the same as well I thought it was pretty,10/6/2018,2
good game on and then tonight didn't go,10/6/2018,2
his way so you know we're probably our,10/6/2018,2
records probably what we deserve and,10/6/2018,2
they probably should have been in a,10/6/2018,2
different order you know the one thing,10/6/2018,2
about this game you're in it together,10/6/2018,2
all the time and you know we all got to,10/6/2018,2
be better if we're gonna have success,10/6/2018,2
that's it was good I thought Riley,10/6/2018,2
really bounce back from Game one I,10/6/2018,2
thought he was real salt,10/6/2018,2
I thought derp me move the puck as well,10/6/2018,2
you know wouldn't spend a ton of time on,10/6/2018,2
his own sauce,10/6/2018,2
valuating the D was harder whichever,10/6/2018,2
ones course you know I mean Michie,10/6/2018,2
one-on-one with the goalie you'll take,10/6/2018,2
it all day just at a breakaway I mean we,10/6/2018,2
had good opportunity here tonight,10/6/2018,2
there's no question about you got to,10/6/2018,2
give their goalie credit yeah that's,10/6/2018,2
what videos foreign in the flight and,10/6/2018,2
good sleep and figure all that out so,10/6/2018,2
you guys travel safe,10/6/2018,2
Maiki rally from 2 down to winning a,10/7/2018,3
tough tough building and some pretty,10/7/2018,3
good hockey players over there how do,10/7/2018,3
you put it all into perspective here now,10/7/2018,3
after the overtime well it's probably,10/7/2018,3
fun for the fans a lot of entertainment,10/7/2018,3
out there I mean you know obviously it,10/7/2018,3
was going in on both nuts and we had a,10/7/2018,3
lot of good plays and I thought you know,10/7/2018,3
they were flying and we were standing,10/7/2018,3
there watching them at the start I don't,10/7/2018,3
know if that's too much respect or what,10/7/2018,3
that was at the start but once we got,10/7/2018,3
playing I thought we did a real good job,10/7/2018,3
and yet you know the puck kept going in,10/7/2018,3
our net so I thought we were home free a,10/7/2018,3
few times but that never happened well I,10/7/2018,3
don't know I like Zach he won't even,10/7/2018,3
talk about him but I mean to me he's,10/7/2018,3
just why does that line play in the,10/7/2018,3
offensive zone all the time because he,10/7/2018,3
just keeps the go get it and go get it,10/7/2018,3
and go get it and go get it and he's,10/7/2018,3
having you when you look around the,10/7/2018,3
league how many guys can skate like that,10/7/2018,3
protect the puck like that like that,10/7/2018,3
we're fortunate to have well just I mean,10/7/2018,3
obviously wasn't going very good and we,10/7/2018,3
needed to do something and you know,10/7/2018,3
capys another big body we'd like him to,10/7/2018,3
decide he wants to play like hymen,10/7/2018,3
that's who we'd like him decided to do,10/7/2018,3
and you know get to the net be on the,10/7/2018,3
inside all the time bring it every,10/7/2018,3
single night if he can do that he can,10/7/2018,3
play with good players,10/7/2018,3
yeah that was good you know what I like,10/7/2018,3
though is I like he's playing had to,10/7/2018,3
head with Mattie I thought that was,10/7/2018,3
really good and it was a good matchup a,10/7/2018,3
good opportunity for Matthews anytime,10/7/2018,3
you're playing against the determined,10/7/2018,3
leader like John is it's I think it's a,10/7/2018,3
real good opportunity for a young guy,10/7/2018,3
you know he's always been the best in my,10/7/2018,3
opinion for a long time in that role as,10/7/2018,3
a matchup guy and so when you can play,10/7/2018,3
well against the month that's important,10/7/2018,3
and obviously Tavares was unreal that,10/7/2018,3
line was unbelievable for us,10/7/2018,3
I mean there's a determined guy you're,10/7/2018,3
not getting a more determined guy in my,10/7/2018,3
opinion a better leader in hockey than,10/7/2018,3
that guy he knows how to play he's,10/7/2018,3
better in the big moments it doesn't,10/7/2018,3
matter who you play with him there are,10/7/2018,3
always good players they might not be,10/7/2018,3
but when they play with him they're good,10/7/2018,3
players and and that's what you want,10/7/2018,3
from Matthews you want a guy who's gonna,10/7/2018,3
you know he wants to be the best player,10/7/2018,3
in hockey in order to do that you got to,10/7/2018,3
play 200 feet you got to play with him,10/7/2018,3
without it,10/7/2018,3
what what do you take away from,10/9/2018,4
tonight's game Mike well two points of,10/9/2018,4
their team competed real hard at the,10/9/2018,4
start especially and I thought we had a,10/9/2018,4
pretty solid third period so a good,10/9/2018,4
night for a team you know obviously both,10/9/2018,4
power plays were real dangerous they had,10/9/2018,4
to be disciplined but a good win for a,10/9/2018,4
team well I would do it but I I liked,10/9/2018,4
her game throughout much more than I,10/9/2018,4
have like there are other games so we,10/9/2018,4
had good intensity good battle everybody,10/9/2018,4
was focused we had good detail in our,10/9/2018,4
game I like to give Y thought they were,10/9/2018,4
real good especially in the third period,10/9/2018,4
they just played in the ozone rolled,10/9/2018,4
around go it's a big body good defense,10/9/2018,4
Lee but I thought Lee Bo and Dennis were,10/9/2018,4
real good and we're on the puck and,10/9/2018,4
we're quick and played heavy so good for,10/9/2018,4
those guys comparisons between Zack and,10/9/2018,4
Caspari and what they offer to their,10/9/2018,4
respective lines with that effort yeah I,10/9/2018,4
mean you know different and I cap he's,10/9/2018,4
done it two nights in a row so I'm just,10/9/2018,4
you know I'm hoping it's gonna be three,10/9/2018,4
and then four and then be every night,10/9/2018,4
but I mean they both beat out Isis,10/9/2018,4
tonight x beats out ice and I know they,10/9/2018,4
didn't get my sis but we got an assist,10/9/2018,4
on that play there went where scores to,10/9/2018,4
put us up to basically a game-winner,10/9/2018,4
those are plays that I mean you gotta,10/9/2018,4
have in lead legs but you gotta be,10/9/2018,4
strong as an ox too and their,10/9/2018,4
determination is great so if Cathy can,10/9/2018,4
keep going obviously it's a real good,10/9/2018,4
sign for us,10/9/2018,4
four-point game for John Tavares tonight,10/11/2018,5
Mikey just continues to go on how do you,10/11/2018,5
put all of this into perspective as you,10/11/2018,5
get ready for a real big game on,10/11/2018,5
Saturday well I thought through two,10/11/2018,5
periods that our team played really well,10/11/2018,5
and we didn't give up much where the,10/11/2018,5
puck lots real while I didn't like her,10/11/2018,5
third as much didn't take care of the,10/11/2018,5
puck was good didn't keep her foot on,10/11/2018,5
the gas quit he's good but no it's a big,10/11/2018,5
win for us here tonight any way you look,10/11/2018,5
at it you know we got a couple of bonus,10/11/2018,5
points three we need six in her segment,10/11/2018,5
to make the playoffs and so we got a,10/11/2018,5
couple extra here tonight which is good,10/11/2018,5
you know I think it's great for all the,10/11/2018,5
guys that are doing some scoring right,10/11/2018,5
now makes you feel good in the end,10/11/2018,5
though you know it's about winning each,10/11/2018,5
and every night and it doesn't really,10/11/2018,5
matter on our team who does this score,10/11/2018,5
as long as we score enough I'm gonna,10/11/2018,5
find a way to win and I think the guy's,10/11/2018,5
been real good about that whether it's,10/11/2018,5
John or Matty or Mitch or any of those,10/11/2018,5
guys they know what they're here for and,10/11/2018,5
you know it's exciting time for our team,10/11/2018,5
but we got to get a lot better as you,10/11/2018,5
know well it's a hard league for a deep,10/11/2018,5
man you know and we got good offensive,10/11/2018,5
players up front and Morgan can pass and,10/11/2018,5
really skate I think Jake was a lot the,10/11/2018,5
same we're not as a deep kind of got one,10/11/2018,5
power play you don't right now is there,10/11/2018,5
- I'm really excited to come back well,10/11/2018,5
up - that'll make a difference there but,10/11/2018,5
obviously the more scoring you have from,10/11/2018,5
them the better off you are and I know,10/11/2018,5
we've gone off guys like that rounding,10/11/2018,5
the players that can really move the,10/11/2018,5
puck to overtime but it just takes time,10/11/2018,5
in the league and,10/11/2018,5
got confidence no one gives it to you,10/11/2018,5
got to earn it and you know I think you,10/11/2018,5
learned a lot last year and he's really,10/11/2018,5
come on again this year and you know he,10/11/2018,5
feels like every night he goes out there,10/11/2018,5
he can do something awesome what do you,10/11/2018,5
make of his superfast start here well I,10/11/2018,5
just think that he had a fast start last,10/11/2018,5
for two and then it was unfortunately,10/11/2018,5
got injured you know he's he's a big man,10/11/2018,5
he's really worked hard on his body he's,10/11/2018,5
worked harder than his skating worked,10/11/2018,5
hard on all parts of a game which is I,10/11/2018,5
think what when you look at our crew,10/11/2018,5
that's what most guys have done they've,10/11/2018,5
really improved and and when you like it,10/11/2018,5
you're willing to work gotta get a,10/11/2018,5
chance to keep getting better and no,10/11/2018,5
different than rise G you're in complex,10/11/2018,5
from being on the league and being,10/11/2018,5
around and understanding what it takes,10/11/2018,5
and no no just with him without the puck,10/11/2018,5
he's better yep just to get nothing to,10/11/2018,5
do with it decided before the game kind,10/11/2018,5
of these there's a little bit of bait it,10/11/2018,5
might be a nice day to walk around in,10/11/2018,5
Washington tomorrow well so they didn't,10/11/2018,5
want to listen to me and I didn't want,10/11/2018,5
to run practice or worked out perfect I,10/11/2018,5
was up it's good,10/11/2018,5
is there any what happened to 33 is we,10/11/2018,5
the wings,10/11/2018,5
what would you know I just I just said,10/11/2018,5
that I thought we'll make it clear this,10/11/2018,5
time is you know I thought we played,10/11/2018,5
really well through 40 minutes and then,10/11/2018,5
I think a moment kind of I don't want to,10/11/2018,5
put our foot on the brake but we were,10/11/2018,5
careful instead of going right after him,10/11/2018,5
but you have to learn to win and,10/11/2018,5
everybody wants us to be a finished,10/11/2018,5
product four games in five games in,10/11/2018,5
let's just not the real world,10/11/2018,5
and so we're just gonna keep getting,10/11/2018,5
better each and every day and give,10/11/2018,5
ourselves a chance to score the one time,10/11/2018,5
we're just the wait team's penalty kill,10/11/2018,5
now yet you know we can do it but a lot,10/11/2018,5
of teams it's it's harder to protect the,10/11/2018,5
puck on that side when you're in a one,10/11/2018,5
time position the trap come so hard are,10/11/2018,5
you from the top and we got I mean we've,10/11/2018,5
got good players obviously he can shoot,10/11/2018,5
it in that spot but because you have a,10/11/2018,5
number of other people that they got to,10/11/2018,5
worry about it would be way easier if,10/11/2018,5
you didn't you just had one guy but,10/11/2018,5
because you've got multiple people you,10/11/2018,5
got a pick kind of what they do and so,10/11/2018,5
that's what makes it well I think we,10/11/2018,5
just started you know over a period of,10/11/2018,5
time here and you know obviously we've,10/11/2018,5
gone through a number of players in the,10/11/2018,5
four-year process here to get here but,10/11/2018,5
we tried to build a team around really,10/11/2018,5
you know I've tried to make it safe form,10/11/2018,5
so it's like family and that's the idea,10/11/2018,5
you build a culture by making it safe,10/11/2018,5
for people so there was an,10/11/2018,5
accountability just like your family and,10/11/2018,5
in the end you have a chance to win in,10/11/2018,5
the end if you can do that and we think,10/11/2018,5
we've taken steps but I mean we're five,10/11/2018,5
games,10/11/2018,5
it's a much time or space out there,10/13/2018,6
would you think of your club to hang in,10/13/2018,6
for 40 minutes to get to do what they,10/13/2018,6
didn't yeah I mean obviously in first,10/13/2018,6
ten minutes weren't very good I don't,10/13/2018,6
know or whatever were very good but I,10/13/2018,6
thought we settled in and played pretty,10/13/2018,6
well and we had some quality chances,10/13/2018,6
really didn't bury him and we were able,10/13/2018,6
to finally get get it going a little bit,10/13/2018,6
my thought here was our best period of,10/13/2018,6
the night two points for us well,10/13/2018,6
obviously in both goaltenders tonight,10/13/2018,6
throw some good chances and point-blank,10/13/2018,6
chances and so I thought you know we had,10/13/2018,6
some bell ringers in the first never got,10/13/2018,6
anything out of it had some bell ringers,10/13/2018,6
down the stretch they were so pretty,10/13/2018,6
made some good saves and it's good to,10/13/2018,6
see and you know they go one on the,10/13/2018,6
power play from the side on a really,10/13/2018,6
good shot what's it like for you to see,10/13/2018,6
him get that first one now,10/13/2018,6
well I you're saying he's a real good,10/13/2018,6
player and his best game - those are,10/13/2018,6
gonna be real important pieces to us as,10/13/2018,6
we move ahead anytime you can find free,10/13/2018,6
players it's positive and these guys are,10/13/2018,6
super intelligent you know I mean he,10/13/2018,6
doesn't need to speak the language but,10/13/2018,6
he's getting better every day so look be,10/13/2018,6
a big part of things to come when we got,10/13/2018,6
this guy who does his work,10/13/2018,6
oh no not really I think you have an off,10/13/2018,6
day to get back to work obviously you,10/13/2018,6
know they would be ready to go and we're,10/13/2018,6
gonna have to get prepared so feel good,10/13/2018,6
we're good on the way home it's nice to,10/13/2018,6
have an off day after a win but we got,10/13/2018,6
to get back right I think you have to,10/13/2018,6
have that obviously it's great that our,10/13/2018,6
big guys got off to a real good start,10/13/2018,6
because I think having them feeling good,10/13/2018,6
is so important and saying that part of,10/13/2018,6
the reason we're gonna have success is,10/13/2018,6
because we got a real good depth both,10/13/2018,6
teams tonight had real good depth and it,10/13/2018,6
was obvious from the games that went on,10/13/2018,6
you can't play in high-level games like,10/13/2018,6
this without four lines that can really,10/13/2018,6
play,10/13/2018,6
response after a long road trip and,10/15/2018,7
dealt with a bit of adversity this,10/15/2018,7
morning with going out yeah I mean,10/15/2018,7
obviously a good night for Sparky played,10/15/2018,7
much better which was good I thought her,10/15/2018,7
team was pretty solid in the second,10/15/2018,7
there we took a bunch of penalties and,10/15/2018,7
then there are people on the ice for bit,10/15/2018,7
and I didn't think were very good at,10/15/2018,7
that point in the game but other now at,10/15/2018,7
Electress to be starting on when do we,10/15/2018,7
play next you'll be starting on Thursday,10/15/2018,7
what's that know we knew we just wanted,10/15/2018,7
to check but as soon as we knew that he,10/15/2018,7
was anything we just decided that we're,10/15/2018,7
going the other way,10/15/2018,7
well I don't know yeah opportunity I,10/15/2018,7
mean is one but you got to be ready for,10/15/2018,7
your opportunity in life when it comes,10/15/2018,7
along that's like any job and it's great,10/15/2018,7
to get the job you gotta be able to do,10/15/2018,7
the job and so you know obviously his,10/15/2018,7
three years previous in the work he's,10/15/2018,7
put in how much stronger has gotten more,10/15/2018,7
poised and he's taking advantage of you,10/15/2018,7
gotta come credit he's he's scoring at,10/15/2018,7
an unbelievable rate and but he's,10/15/2018,7
physical and he's fast and he's,10/15/2018,7
tenacious and that lines been good and,10/15/2018,7
plenty against good players tonight and,10/15/2018,7
he was good well you know what I like to,10/15/2018,7
put Austin tonight is he played,10/15/2018,7
head-to-head Kopitar and it was really,10/15/2018,7
good and you know we're blessed to have,10/15/2018,7
a guy that can play with him without and,10/15/2018,7
without sighs and now with the skating,10/15/2018,7
the way it is you know he was a real,10/15/2018,7
player and he's just growing he's just a,10/15/2018,7
kid he's just gonna get better and so,10/15/2018,7
you know he's dangerous when he's on the,10/15/2018,7
ice and that lines a good line right now,10/15/2018,7
so we're fortunate that we we appear to,10/15/2018,7
have quite a bit of depth we still are,10/15/2018,7
kind of evolving trying to figure out,10/15/2018,7
how to play everybody but you know I,10/15/2018,7
think we're going the right direction,10/15/2018,7
ya know is good player I said all the,10/15/2018,7
time telogen player you know I don't,10/15/2018,7
know where I think it was for Thunder,10/15/2018,7
team last year and five on five scoring,10/15/2018,7
doesn't get to play on a power play and,10/15/2018,7
I don't know where he is,10/15/2018,7
this year on it but you know he,10/15/2018,7
generates good offense and forecheck and,10/15/2018,7
heavy play that line wasn't heavy enough,10/15/2018,7
tonight,10/15/2018,7
they didn't spin around in the ozone,10/15/2018,7
like they normally do but they were,10/15/2018,7
still effective yeah I mean I just think,10/15/2018,7
that apparently killed you know I think,10/15/2018,7
EJ doesn't his job we've got a good,10/15/2018,7
scheme good players Lind homecoming now,10/15/2018,7
gives us another elite penalty killer,10/15/2018,7
real good mind real smart so that helps,10/15/2018,7
out as well and then you know two verse,10/15/2018,7
can take draws for us I don't even know,10/15/2018,7
if I use mention tonight on the family,10/15/2018,7
killed or not tell you the truth but,10/15/2018,7
easing that well it probably didn't,10/15/2018,7
because he was in the Box all the time,10/15/2018,7
the observations might get inside the,10/18/2018,8
room I didn't give you guys enough,10/18/2018,8
second chance is the initial opportunity,10/18/2018,8
the secondary no I agree with that I,10/18/2018,8
thought my doctor team played good I,10/18/2018,8
didn't think there was tons of room out,10/18/2018,8
there tonight I thought they played fast,10/18/2018,8
played with good structure you know it's,10/18/2018,8
not often you see our team get no goals,10/18/2018,8
and the other thing I'd say to you is,10/18/2018,8
that you know I just thought they did a,10/18/2018,8
good job and I thought there was no room,10/18/2018,8
they kept us on the outside a bit I like,10/18/2018,8
threw players I thought their players,10/18/2018,8
played good,10/18/2018,8
well that thought they did a good job of,10/18/2018,8
that uh you know I mean it's one nothing,10/18/2018,8
game right and it's it's a grind out,10/18/2018,8
there and there's no room I thought they,10/18/2018,8
were better than us in the first I,10/18/2018,8
thought we took over for about fourteen,10/18/2018,8
minutes of the second then they,10/18/2018,8
dominated the last six minutes of the,10/18/2018,8
second but you know when you're good,10/18/2018,8
team and you're playing good teams,10/18/2018,8
there's no room that's just the reality,10/18/2018,8
it gets to be like there's no room and,10/18/2018,8
so you have to find a way to play your,10/18/2018,8
game within the no room yeah I mean you,10/18/2018,8
always want that at them to get it right,10/18/2018,8
they missed it too those things happen,10/18/2018,8
yeah you know I think I think all,10/18/2018,8
victories you got to earn and it was,10/18/2018,8
right there for us to find another step,10/18/2018,8
and to get better and find a way to get,10/18/2018,8
on the inside a little more and they did,10/18/2018,8
a good job and they kept us from doing,10/18/2018,8
that so there's a lesson learned in that,10/18/2018,8
and you know there were more veteran,10/18/2018,8
polish playoff team than we are and,10/18/2018,8
Mitchell,10/18/2018,8
well I thought I actually thought we,10/20/2018,9
skated a real good at the start but I,10/20/2018,9
thought st. Louis came in here to play,10/20/2018,9
hard they were on the inside they backed,10/20/2018,9
check they worked hard we stayed on the,10/20/2018,9
outside never got the puck Lynette never,10/20/2018,9
got inside in the end they worked hard,10/20/2018,9
and we did they compete they competed,10/20/2018,9
harder on the puck in the hard areas and,10/20/2018,9
we turned the puck over and weren't good,10/20/2018,9
enough so I thought we had a bit of that,10/20/2018,9
the other night and then you know,10/20/2018,9
obviously we're figuring out that we,10/20/2018,9
scored her early we scored easy you know,10/20/2018,9
what was pretty loose and everything was,10/20/2018,9
great now we're finding out it's the NHL,10/20/2018,9
it's hard to score teams compete hard on,10/20/2018,9
yeah teams adjust and they're gonna play,10/20/2018,9
a heart and so we gotta get our mojo,10/20/2018,9
back but going to work and we'll do that,10/20/2018,9
we'll go to work tomorrow on and take it,10/20/2018,9
off to a money and then have another,10/20/2018,9
work day before we go to Winnipeg so not,10/20/2018,9
good enough,10/20/2018,9
well I like to parts that I don't think,10/20/2018,9
we've been as good but I mean I just,10/20/2018,9
talked above the puck numbers at their,10/20/2018,9
line people inside working are competing,10/20/2018,9
hard but that's the NHL I mean you can't,10/20/2018,9
expect it to be like it was I don't,10/20/2018,9
think anybody's actually thinking that,10/20/2018,9
we got off to a good start,10/20/2018,9
and then we haven't been as good as we,10/20/2018,9
need to be to be successful so let's get,10/20/2018,9
a turn around and get feeling good about,10/20/2018,9
ourselves,10/20/2018,9
yeah well good thing about it I don't,10/20/2018,9
have to decide that right now by the,10/20/2018,9
time I'm done watching the game tape,10/20/2018,9
prior to practice and then I'll have a,10/20/2018,9
good handle on that oh yeah I mean for,10/20/2018,9
sure you can put everything back or you,10/20/2018,9
can change it all we'll see but we'll,10/20/2018,9
look at it carefully without emotion and,10/20/2018,9
then make that decision,10/20/2018,9
what will you take from another road win,10/24/2018,10
here Mike and get ready to head back to,10/24/2018,10
drama boy real simple for us if you want,10/24/2018,10
to play right and you want to play hard,10/24/2018,10
and suddenly you look fast again we've,10/24/2018,10
looked real slow the last two games and,10/24/2018,10
didn't come out of our own zone and,10/24/2018,10
tonight we look fast third period you,10/24/2018,10
know we still gotta learn how to win,10/24/2018,10
there's no reason to play in your own,10/24/2018,10
zone,10/24/2018,10
you could still play in the offensive,10/24/2018,10
zone and keep your foot on the gas so,10/24/2018,10
that'll come with time but big win for,10/24/2018,10
our team here tonight and you know we,10/24/2018,10
got a day off tomorrow good practice and,10/24/2018,10
we get Winnipeg again it's nice to play,10/24/2018,10
the same good team twice in a row well,10/24/2018,10
that's that was a huge goal for us,10/24/2018,10
obviously Bojana but I mean it's winning,10/24/2018,10
face off sets stopped on the right spots,10/24/2018,10
it's stand composed so you keep,10/24/2018,10
attacking instead of back you know those,10/24/2018,10
are all things you learn how to do,10/24/2018,10
booing and when you got a lot of kids,10/24/2018,10
often it takes you a little bit of time,10/24/2018,10
but you learn over time but I liked our,10/24/2018,10
effort tonight I thought we'd compete it,10/24/2018,10
I thought we skated that we worked and,10/24/2018,10
you know we hadn't seen that in a couple,10/24/2018,10
games so it was good to see that back,10/24/2018,10
again and it's good for the guys to,10/24/2018,10
leave the ring feeling good well I mean,10/24/2018,10
innocent Calgary you know get him off to,10/24/2018,10
tonight and obviously and as he heard,10/24/2018,10
one off the bar there later,10/24/2018,10
I mean he's important goal scorer for us,10/24/2018,10
we need him to feel good their line is,10/24/2018,10
getting away better obviously their,10/24/2018,10
important line for us we expect them to,10/24/2018,10
play important minutes and we need him,10/24/2018,10
to score he knows that so it's good he's,10/24/2018,10
stuck with it and kept working and you,10/24/2018,10
know know they'll start going in for,10/24/2018,10
OJ's effort on the goal and in terms of,10/24/2018,10
getting all four lines into it tonight,10/24/2018,10
what do you think yeah I mean they,10/24/2018,10
didn't play for lives you know so what's,10/24/2018,10
tough getting your guys on the ice there,10/24/2018,10
and just the way the game was but in,10/24/2018,10
saying that you know obviously goat you,10/24/2018,10
always guys start our line up and it,10/24/2018,10
finds a way to play every night so he's,10/24/2018,10
doing good stuff,10/24/2018,10
top line that you expect to see and make,10/24/2018,10
these kind of plays now well you're,10/24/2018,10
expecting them to do it on a regular,10/24/2018,10
basis oh it's real clear he understands,10/24/2018,10
his good players do it every day and,10/24/2018,10
then they keep getting better they don't,10/24/2018,10
get satisfied to get hungrier and when,10/24/2018,10
you're around good players and Matthews,10/24/2018,10
but a real good veteran and Marlowe I,10/24/2018,10
mean they keep you pretty even keel and,10/24/2018,10
yeah and we need him to be a good player,10/24/2018,10
for us he's done,10/24/2018,10
describe it Mike there's a character,10/27/2018,11
victory to come back after losing Austin,10/27/2018,11
as early as you did and then yeah I mean,10/27/2018,11
the game they were playing harder than,10/27/2018,11
us you know would beat him earlier in,10/27/2018,11
the week and they were competing at a,10/27/2018,11
level we weren't quite as competitive as,10/27/2018,11
em we did some silly things like their,10/27/2018,11
power play goal should have been down,10/27/2018,11
200 feet we we told drag that her blue,10/27/2018,11
line with 2d active twice for two,10/27/2018,11
breakaway Freddy stopped one and tried,10/27/2018,11
to scored on the other one and then you,10/27/2018,11
know we made a decision to come out and,10/27/2018,11
play right in the third and when we did,10/27/2018,11
that we were fortunate to in the end get,10/27/2018,11
it to go your way but it's a good win,10/27/2018,11
for our team and anytime you get a real,10/27/2018,11
good team twice in a week and you can,10/27/2018,11
get it done it's positive he's got a no,10/27/2018,11
shoulder injury they'll look at it on,10/27/2018,11
Monday and we'll know more on Monday,10/27/2018,11
it's not practicing tomorrow and won't,10/27/2018,11
be playing on I think we play Monday,10/27/2018,11
right I won't be playing on Monday and,10/27/2018,11
then you know we'll know more at that,10/27/2018,11
time so we'll give me an update on,10/27/2018,11
Monday he's not ready right away for,10/27/2018,11
sure no it's not the same shoulder it's,10/27/2018,11
not you know he did his work this summer,10/27/2018,11
got way stronger built muscle around his,10/27/2018,11
shoulder joints to protect himself,10/27/2018,11
sometimes things happen,10/27/2018,11
well what we did is we just thought we,10/27/2018,11
didn't have any lines we thought that we,10/27/2018,11
thought that Hyman and John could do,10/27/2018,11
whatever we didn't have anything going,10/27/2018,11
we needed to change we knew that had,10/27/2018,11
worked in the past you can kind of give,10/27/2018,11
us a match up against a flee and free up,10/27/2018,11
to viruses lying a little bit that's,10/27/2018,11
what we tried to do yeah no we'll look,10/27/2018,11
at it here tomorrow we'll look at the,10/27/2018,11
game and figure out what direction we're,10/27/2018,11
going to go I don't know if we've done,10/27/2018,11
that this year at home had we done this,10/27/2018,11
year at home I don't know if we had,10/27/2018,11
normally at home we we tighten up when,10/27/2018,11
we've given up a goal I didn't think,10/27/2018,11
that happened today I thought we just,10/27/2018,11
got determined which was nice you know I,10/27/2018,11
didn't think we came out and and didn't,10/27/2018,11
play I thought we were playing just fine,10/27/2018,11
everything was going good the game was,10/27/2018,11
going good two good teams playing and,10/27/2018,11
they scored on the power play so I don't,10/27/2018,11
know I don't spend a lot of time,10/27/2018,11
thinking about that,10/27/2018,11
I said I just thought of septums of,10/29/2018,12
built Peters coach performance that they,10/29/2018,12
saw tonight saw a lot of it when he was,10/29/2018,12
in Carolina,10/29/2018,12
did you see more of that here tonight,10/29/2018,12
yeah I mean I I just thought they were,10/29/2018,12
prepared I thought they skated I thought,10/29/2018,12
they worked I thought they'd sailed,10/29/2018,12
under zone meters up the ice and the,10/29/2018,12
first period you know we turned a puck,10/29/2018,12
over it's it's the game's frustrating,10/29/2018,12
when the other team works harder than,10/29/2018,12
you,10/29/2018,12
that's why that's why we watch them,10/29/2018,12
right you know so but I didn't think I,10/29/2018,12
didn't think our top group had a good,10/29/2018,12
night though you know what I mean so,10/29/2018,12
you're talking about a different group,10/29/2018,12
to me our top group playing against,10/29/2018,12
their top groups weren't weren't good,10/29/2018,12
enough so when you look at the whole,10/29/2018,12
group obviously we weren't good enough,10/29/2018,12
and so we'll get an opportunity to ask,10/29/2018,12
yourself why and and get it straight,10/29/2018,12
note so we can be better,10/29/2018,12
well I thought it was I thought it was,11/1/2018,13
pretty good hockey game I thought her,11/1/2018,13
team was engaged but we worked hard I,11/1/2018,13
thought was started good you know in the,11/1/2018,13
end you got a score right and I thought,11/1/2018,13
we had good tips and opportunities on,11/1/2018,13
her power play early they got a tip and,11/1/2018,13
they scored mmm my god we had a real,11/1/2018,13
good push in the third know what I liked,11/1/2018,13
the bonus is we didn't lose our focus we,11/1/2018,13
didn't start running around the rink we,11/1/2018,13
kind of stayed with it I don't think,11/1/2018,13
they give up very much until the end and,11/1/2018,13
I don't think we gave up very much knee,11/1/2018,13
under gotta find a way to win the game,11/1/2018,13
so I didn't know that but you know in,11/1/2018,13
saying that I like I think we played pit,11/1/2018,13
in one of those games and I thought it,11/1/2018,13
was a game we had tons of chances didn't,11/1/2018,13
score we played Winnipeg in one of those,11/1/2018,13
games I thought it was a heck of a game,11/1/2018,13
when we started good in the first so I,11/1/2018,13
don't I can't count back all the games,11/1/2018,13
in my head I know in Calgary we didn't,11/1/2018,13
deserve to score but I mean it is what,11/1/2018,13
it is a little adversity for our group,11/1/2018,13
dig in that's it and then you go through,11/1/2018,13
it our times every year just dig in and,11/1/2018,13
find a way to win games that's it I,11/1/2018,13
thought a power play was dangerous I,11/1/2018,13
thought we had a lot of looks but we,11/1/2018,13
didn't shoot it in the empty net you,11/1/2018,13
know we had it when you think about it,11/1/2018,13
we held on michey stick and we had a,11/1/2018,13
lone John versus stick a number of time,11/1/2018,13
with real good looks and didn't go in,11/1/2018,13
the net no you know I don't know if I'm,11/1/2018,13
picking the guys that's who I want on we,11/1/2018,13
had those guys on a two-on-one and they,11/1/2018,13
lost the puck like I'll take those guys,11/1/2018,13
all day long in those situations in over,11/1/2018,13
a period of time it'll go in,11/1/2018,13
yeah I thought that der me had a good,11/1/2018,13
game he looked kind of like he was back,11/1/2018,13
to last year I thought Hall started good,11/1/2018,13
you know we had the one tough shift,11/1/2018,13
there and the ice and the gold games but,11/1/2018,13
you know good for him he got into play,11/1/2018,13
talking with the players about the,11/3/2018,14
cliche of 60 minutes of hockey but was,11/3/2018,14
that as close to 60 as your clubs been,11/3/2018,14
able to play what was a good game for us,11/3/2018,14
to make we started good and you know,11/3/2018,14
Tavares is lying and I was lying we're,11/3/2018,14
both dominant and played very well we,11/3/2018,14
were able to score first which is,11/3/2018,14
important we haven't done it enough this,11/3/2018,14
year instead so you're not chasing the,11/3/2018,14
game and then I thought everyone,11/3/2018,14
contributed so his big game 40 well I,11/3/2018,14
mean it hasn't been as effective as like,11/3/2018,14
the V we we haven't been able to clear,11/3/2018,14
the puck very good this year we've been,11/3/2018,14
scored on so many times when we failed,11/3/2018,14
to clear and and we were able to do a,11/3/2018,14
good job tonight my DJ does a real good,11/3/2018,14
job with it it hasn't chosen in the,11/3/2018,14
results so far this year and you want to,11/3/2018,14
be a top penalty killing team we've got,11/3/2018,14
good people so yeah that'll run the self,11/3/2018,14
machine well I mean Mitch's good player,11/3/2018,14
for us I thought that line was really,11/3/2018,14
really good tonight which was a good,11/3/2018,14
player but you know with her without the,11/3/2018,14
puck the best he plays I say this all,11/3/2018,14
the time is when he's really good,11/3/2018,14
defensively than he has the puck all the,11/3/2018,14
time and he was tonight well I mean,11/3/2018,14
should had a couple I don't worry too,11/3/2018,14
much but he does good things every game,11/3/2018,14
the one thing about Zack he's he's not,11/3/2018,14
like a lot of people is his confidence,11/3/2018,14
doesn't come and go he just does the,11/3/2018,14
right thing every day and and it's not,11/3/2018,14
really affected by the results and so,11/3/2018,14
but it's good for any player no one,11/3/2018,14
likes to go wrong though it's going so,11/3/2018,14
good for him yeah for sure and saying,11/3/2018,14
that though we did last game too you,11/3/2018,14
know in the end last game when you look,11/3/2018,14
at it we should have found a way to win,11/3/2018,14
that game we had lots of opportunity and,11/3/2018,14
should have won but we didn't but,11/3/2018,14
sometimes when games you shouldn't so,11/3/2018,14
just do good things good things happen,11/3/2018,14
Morgan's having great offensive numbers,11/3/2018,14
of course you,11/3/2018,14
while that Morgan was really good,11/3/2018,14
defensively today sometimes you know,11/3/2018,14
he's always good old ffensive LY but,11/3/2018,14
sometimes not quite as good today was,11/3/2018,14
really good defensively and really,11/3/2018,14
committed and dal then there's no one,11/3/2018,14
who likes being a leaf more on our team,11/3/2018,14
than than Morgan and he provides,11/3/2018,14
leadership that way he's got,11/3/2018,14
unbelievable enthusiasm every day and no,11/3/2018,14
zest for life and he shares that with,11/3/2018,14
the guys and he you need energy people,11/3/2018,14
he's one of those good especially,11/3/2018,14
against the office they have yeah I,11/3/2018,14
thought our team did a real good job for,11/3/2018,14
him and yet when he was called upon,11/3/2018,14
eating nice job you know good for him I,11/3/2018,14
thought he played well there there Nitin,11/3/2018,14
but their goalie was good and so it's,11/3/2018,14
nice to be rewarded when you click it,11/3/2018,14
yeah I don't know the answer let what I,11/3/2018,14
would tell you is that you know,11/3/2018,14
obviously we lost a couple and we,11/3/2018,14
thought we were going in the right,11/3/2018,14
direction last game didn't get rewarded,11/3/2018,14
and just stuck with it and we're,11/3/2018,14
determined tonight and in the end phone,11/3/2018,14
away to win again yeah I mean I'm happy,11/3/2018,14
with what I'm seeing from our team most,11/3/2018,14
nights and be honest with you we've had,11/3/2018,14
a couple nights that haven't gone as,11/3/2018,14
good you know what I like to do is just,11/3/2018,14
kind of be steady on the rudders yeah,11/3/2018,14
the seasons always has these little ebbs,11/3/2018,14
and flows and you enjoy it when it's,11/3/2018,14
going good and you enjoy the duress when,11/3/2018,14
it's not how's that,11/3/2018,14
ability in that secondary to keep its,11/6/2018,15
head above water your goaltending key to,11/6/2018,15
tonight's victory perhaps well I thought,11/6/2018,15
we started real good the first 10,11/6/2018,15
minutes and then I thought we got,11/6/2018,15
fooling around with a puck and then they,11/6/2018,15
showed us how fast they were and I,11/6/2018,15
thought they really dominated the second,11/6/2018,15
period we were lucky to get on the,11/6/2018,15
second I didn't mind her third you know,11/6/2018,15
in the end when you look at this game,11/6/2018,15
kind of like when Pittsburgh left here,11/6/2018,15
with the points or her Dallas left here,11/6/2018,15
with the points you thought you'd had,11/6/2018,15
done enough to win and you didn't so,11/6/2018,15
tonight's she was on the other foot and,11/6/2018,15
we'll take her and maybe we can loosen,11/6/2018,15
up at home a little bit and play that,11/6/2018,15
line was our best line at the start of,11/6/2018,15
the game I thought it was our quickest,11/6/2018,15
our most effective line we were playing,11/6/2018,15
good we're making plays and then,11/6/2018,15
suddenly in the second note we never,11/6/2018,15
made one play I mean I don't know how,11/6/2018,15
many times we iced puck and you know,11/6/2018,15
we're just under seized they were they,11/6/2018,15
were quick there on top of us I talked,11/6/2018,15
about that this morning is the speed,11/6/2018,15
through the middle of rink on their team,11/6/2018,15
is a really really good and when we got,11/6/2018,15
her heels and the gun on top they were,11/6/2018,15
quicker but I thought that line was real,11/6/2018,15
effective and obviously you need,11/6/2018,15
everybody involved in the offense so,11/6/2018,15
it's great to see brownie score didn't,11/6/2018,15
engage Pittsburgh but okay he played,11/6/2018,15
real well,11/6/2018,15
games for sure and then does a good job,11/6/2018,15
for us all the time you know we expect,11/6/2018,15
him every once in a while to win us a,11/6/2018,15
game and and we play real well and don't,11/6/2018,15
give up anything and he gets the win and,11/6/2018,15
even the shadowed sometimes that's a,11/6/2018,15
bonus for him you know so it goes both,11/6/2018,15
ways we're all in it together and but I,11/6/2018,15
thought Freddy was really strong for us,11/6/2018,15
tonight,11/6/2018,15
[Music],11/6/2018,15
yeah I mean probably just turned out,11/6/2018,15
that way couldn't get off the ice I mean,11/6/2018,15
but it wasn't it wasn't that but run-run,11/6/2018,15
knows where to stand when the game's on,11/6/2018,15
the line so and having a little,11/6/2018,15
knowledge and being a veteran and being,11/6/2018,15
in the right spot never hurt anybody,11/6/2018,15
well you think you know it was good for,11/9/2018,16
him he skated you know he drove the,11/9/2018,16
middle heart and was rewarded for it and,11/9/2018,16
so he seems to be getting more rhythm in,11/9/2018,16
his game I thought that line was good,11/9/2018,16
again so it's important that those guys,11/9/2018,16
get home but it was a good game everyone,11/9/2018,16
got to play everyone you know had some,11/9/2018,16
puck touches and so in the end you leave,11/9/2018,16
feeling good and plus we didn't put too,11/9/2018,16
much stress on her team playing,11/9/2018,16
back-to-back no gives us a better,11/9/2018,16
opportunity well I mean you know I'm not,11/9/2018,16
begging a lot of if the players work,11/9/2018,16
real hard and we do things right,11/9/2018,16
together we have a chance to have a lot,11/9/2018,16
of success and so that's what you're,11/9/2018,16
trying to do each and every day and some,11/9/2018,16
days it goes good know there was a lot,11/9/2018,16
of those C&I; pucks tonight lady they,11/9/2018,16
went through crowds and you know it's,11/9/2018,16
never fun being on the wrong end of,11/9/2018,16
those more fun being on the right end,11/9/2018,16
well I mean I don't think our last,11/9/2018,16
couple were any better than like when we,11/9/2018,16
lost the Dallas or allows the Pittsburgh,11/9/2018,16
be honest with you probably played,11/9/2018,16
better in those games but the puck went,11/9/2018,16
in that's what happens sometimes you,11/9/2018,16
know at home when it doesn't go your way,11/9/2018,16
and you think it should you start,11/9/2018,16
pressing a little bit so I think that,11/9/2018,16
gets in your way a little bit but,11/9/2018,16
ideally this will loosen us up at home,11/9/2018,16
we'll play better,11/9/2018,16
but you know when you see these hulking,11/9/2018,16
guys in there I think you know I saw the,11/9/2018,16
you starters were sitting on the chairs,11/9/2018,16
like I'm watching that what do you think,11/9/2018,16
the significance is for your players to,11/9/2018,16
see something well we're really lucky to,11/9/2018,16
be here we talked about that before we,11/9/2018,16
went out to enjoy the ceremony I mean,11/9/2018,16
you know when you walk out and lining,11/9/2018,16
McDonald's leading the way and he's,11/9/2018,16
standing right there and you get to,11/9/2018,16
shake his hand and girls there and then,11/9/2018,16
you go through and Brian trochees there,11/9/2018,16
and go through all these guys,11/9/2018,16
there have been stars and then the new,11/9/2018,16
inductees walked by and including mr.,11/9/2018,16
Batman I mean I think it's a special,11/9/2018,16
thing and anybody who's been to to the,11/9/2018,16
ceremony,11/9/2018,16
it's a club like no other if you're,11/9/2018,16
involved in hockey you want to I mean,11/9/2018,16
you don't even dream of being in that,11/9/2018,16
Club but it'd be nice to be in that Club,11/9/2018,16
and that's how special it is and I don't,11/9/2018,16
the guys that walked by they kind of got,11/9/2018,16
jammed up that came on our bench so we,11/9/2018,16
got to talk to each one of them which,11/9/2018,16
was good before they went out the right,11/9/2018,16
way and so that made a little more,11/9/2018,16
special but you know it's just it's,11/9/2018,16
fantastic for them and their families,11/9/2018,16
and I think it's a real honor,11/9/2018,16
not a good road start as your club has,11/10/2018,17
had here Mike just unable to capitalize,11/10/2018,17
it moving forward well we didn't score,11/10/2018,17
and then they came out and didn't they,11/10/2018,17
got energy and obviously then the rest,11/10/2018,17
is history so it's you know it's an,11/10/2018,17
unfortunate thing we didn't we didn't,11/10/2018,17
get her done when we had all those,11/10/2018,17
opportunities early and in the end we,11/10/2018,17
have she's thinking scored I think we're,11/10/2018,17
like I said we're all over them you know,11/10/2018,17
when they get to the first period,11/10/2018,17
through the first period and nothing's,11/10/2018,17
happened the hordes so I thought we came,11/10/2018,17
out and started they scored and then,11/10/2018,17
they got energy and they were quicker,11/10/2018,17
than us at the second crude I still,11/10/2018,17
thought we had a real good start to the,11/10/2018,17
third we got her so setup when we took,11/10/2018,17
the penalty well they really did on the,11/10/2018,17
power play I mean I got a couple they're,11/10/2018,17
on the power play for sure I thought,11/10/2018,17
they were good obviously they're a real,11/10/2018,17
good line and their power play has,11/10/2018,17
really been clicking coming in it's not,11/10/2018,17
the best in the league but it's it's,11/10/2018,17
moving too fast in that direction and,11/10/2018,17
you got to give him credit he's a good,11/10/2018,17
player and it's playing with good line,11/10/2018,17
meets what do you see in Garrett tonight,11/10/2018,17
well I mean I don't know I haven't,11/10/2018,17
looked at the tape so I can't really,11/10/2018,17
tell you there the bottom line is you,11/10/2018,17
went together and lose together and we,11/10/2018,17
got off to a good start we had,11/10/2018,17
everything going the way we want it I,11/10/2018,17
look like we were prepared look like we,11/10/2018,17
had good energy in the end they were,11/10/2018,17
better long season you're 6 and 1 on the,11/10/2018,17
road headed to California you've got to,11/10/2018,17
be happy overall in the big picture in,11/10/2018,17
that regard yeah I mean I don't think,11/10/2018,17
about six and one I think about all in,11/10/2018,17
one tonight that's where we're playing,11/10/2018,17
tonight's game it will just get,11/10/2018,17
regrouped and get back at her but things,11/10/2018,17
have gone well for us all year and we,11/10/2018,17
plan on regrouping in the playoff,11/10/2018,17
like we know but all the skill and,11/13/2018,18
esteem of this speed essential to like,11/13/2018,18
creating what you guys were able to,11/13/2018,18
accomplish yeah we talked about that,11/13/2018,18
well maybe we wanted to play fast all,11/13/2018,18
this later and they want to get off to a,11/13/2018,18
good start on this trip I thought we did,11/13/2018,18
that tonight so good one for they called,11/13/2018,18
more felons tonight we played pretty,11/13/2018,18
much the same most times it was nice,11/13/2018,18
power play to score get that feeling,11/13/2018,18
back to that good chances out in the,11/13/2018,18
score so it's good for the power play,11/13/2018,18
how essential guys like nasim and John,11/13/2018,18
in the middle when you've got guys like,11/13/2018,18
Morgan and Mitch able to get them the,11/13/2018,18
why they're real important,11/13/2018,18
obviously on our goals tonight the net,11/13/2018,18
you know to me that's that's why you,11/13/2018,18
score you need people out the net,11/13/2018,18
all about speedin club depth here,11/15/2018,19
tonight Mike in terms of the yeah I,11/15/2018,19
thought we did a good job obviously you,11/15/2018,19
know a good discipline and I thought we,11/15/2018,19
played pretty good it was a good win,11/15/2018,19
here it's always hard to win in here,11/15/2018,19
they've got a good hockey club real,11/15/2018,19
active back in but I thought we got good,11/15/2018,19
goaltending and and pretty good,11/15/2018,19
specialty teams and then the info no way,11/15/2018,19
to win well I mean we started real good,11/15/2018,19
and then we stopped playing on the last,11/15/2018,19
ten and we just said instead of you know,11/15/2018,19
getting involved in all the crop why,11/15/2018,19
don't we just play because we're quicker,11/15/2018,19
than them and and so in the end I,11/15/2018,19
thought when we got refocused we got,11/15/2018,19
playing better a lot her second period,11/15/2018,19
was their best yeah I thought they were,11/15/2018,19
good tonight I thought Lindy's line was,11/15/2018,19
that's the best they've been but I,11/15/2018,19
thought ghost line was effective as well,11/15/2018,19
so who had good depth and you know,11/15/2018,19
that's where it's important on over,11/15/2018,19
player guys so I was important,11/15/2018,19
you felt like it you guys were at the,11/15/2018,19
game right okay no I mean obviously the,11/15/2018,19
biggest thing about those is it got us a,11/15/2018,19
power play to start the game they're,11/15/2018,19
gonna say it's not a power play goal cuz,11/15/2018,19
I think it was one second or something,11/15/2018,19
that's power play goal it's a great way,11/15/2018,19
to start the game you like to score,11/15/2018,19
first I thought we did that to me you,11/15/2018,19
know there's no one tougher on their,11/15/2018,19
team than Big Joe Big Joe wants to look,11/15/2018,19
after something that happened in the,11/15/2018,19
past he could probably do that so to me,11/15/2018,19
it was good for now is now is that kind,11/15/2018,19
of guys a little bit greasy anyway so,11/15/2018,19
why not iced intelligence and,11/15/2018,19
aggressiveness a key offensively,11/15/2018,19
short-handed here tonight well I just,11/15/2018,19
thought we had some good looks you know,11/15/2018,19
obviously short-handed we cut out a,11/15/2018,19
couple more but we hit the post there or,11/15/2018,19
I'm on the other one I just thought that,11/15/2018,19
our penalty kill was good we're on our,11/15/2018,19
toes pretty good and in the end like I,11/15/2018,19
said good goaltending,11/15/2018,19
was that a grinding victory mic well,11/16/2018,20
obviously I mean it's our fifth game in,11/16/2018,20
eight nights and you know when you look,11/16/2018,20
at this schedule and it's like that you,11/16/2018,20
don't know figuring out much opportunity,11/16/2018,20
by third guys stayed with it here,11/16/2018,20
tonight I didn't think our energy was,11/16/2018,20
like it's been but I thought we found a,11/16/2018,20
way to win the game and you know it was,11/16/2018,20
good for sparks to was ideally now he,11/16/2018,20
can relax and and earn some confidence,11/16/2018,20
and feel good about himself and play,11/16/2018,20
well in the National League well I just,11/16/2018,20
think he he just does a right and you,11/16/2018,20
know lots of nights in a league you,11/16/2018,20
don't have your best of but as long as,11/16/2018,20
you compete and you work hard and things,11/16/2018,20
are gonna go your way and obviously it,11/16/2018,20
was good play by him real good play by,11/16/2018,20
McKeon and rice to finish it off we,11/16/2018,20
needed points and it was good we got him,11/16/2018,20
why that I thought it was Gardner's best,11/16/2018,20
game tonight maybe of the year and you,11/16/2018,20
know was he's always steady for us so,11/16/2018,20
obviously our top four does a real good,11/16/2018,20
job for us that way yeah that's great,11/16/2018,20
question don't know the answer a lot I,11/16/2018,20
just know that you know he was obviously,11/16/2018,20
feeling real good out there was smooth,11/16/2018,20
he was skating he was moving the boxes,11/16/2018,20
it was physically determined he was a,11/16/2018,20
good player my finish can be fleeting,11/16/2018,20
Mike what's enabled your club to keep it,11/16/2018,20
for such a long stretch that's a real,11/16/2018,20
good question you know I think partly we,11/16/2018,20
got some real good veterans in haensi,11/16/2018,20
and Tavares and Marlo and then just try,11/16/2018,20
to be steady on the rudder I mean we,11/16/2018,20
think we have a chance to be a real good,11/16/2018,20
team over time and just got to keep,11/16/2018,20
building but the league's very very good,11/16/2018,20
and each night you play a team you look,11/16/2018,20
at the other team before the game each,11/16/2018,20
night and you wonder a whole how are we,11/16/2018,20
gonna win and but you know you just find,11/16/2018,20
a way to do things right we've got good,11/16/2018,20
goaltending pretty good specialty teams,11/16/2018,20
and we're finding ways,11/16/2018,20
yeah I mean you know I've had lots good,11/16/2018,20
teams come out here and not do it and,11/16/2018,20
you know one of these teams always get,11/16/2018,20
you back to back and usually they get,11/16/2018,20
you time we're fortunate obviously to,11/16/2018,20
win the hockey game but you know it's,11/16/2018,20
just like anything you just try to March,11/16/2018,20
ahead so you know we got a big game when,11/16/2018,20
we get home we'll fly home tomorrow and,11/16/2018,20
try to have get rested and and then,11/16/2018,20
skate and get prepared for the next game,11/16/2018,20
was there an aspect of a team victory,11/19/2018,21
that stood up for you here tonight well,11/19/2018,21
I mean I thought it looked like we were,11/19/2018,21
gonna get out of the first down one,11/19/2018,21
nothing and I thought that was great I,11/19/2018,21
mean obviously we're skating in mud,11/19/2018,21
there and we're going very good but you,11/19/2018,21
know I like it sign up good team we had,11/19/2018,21
good goaltending incentive good team,11/19/2018,21
that you're able to kind of get yourself,11/19/2018,21
gathered when you had no legs and get,11/19/2018,21
playing and just stick with it and find,11/19/2018,21
a way to win,11/19/2018,21
you know I thought Lindy's landed a real,11/19/2018,21
good job for us tonight and then you,11/19/2018,21
know one of the guys kind of came alive,11/19/2018,21
and we found a way but well Freddie it,11/19/2018,21
doesn't that well I think you know he's,11/19/2018,21
a real good person we like him he's got,11/19/2018,21
good speed he's got some skill on the,11/19/2018,21
powerplay,11/19/2018,21
it hasn't showed up and points for him,11/19/2018,21
but it will it's always nice when a guy,11/19/2018,21
like that gets cool so that it needs a,11/19/2018,21
little more confidence they'll start,11/19/2018,21
going in for me it hurt the perk that,11/19/2018,21
post earlier there Natan Anaheim he was,11/19/2018,21
home free wide open in front of the net,11/19/2018,21
and miss the net you know as his,11/19/2018,21
confidence comes back he'll start to,11/19/2018,21
score a little bit so it's good for him,11/19/2018,21
[Music],11/19/2018,21
he's coming obviously he just keeps,11/19/2018,21
getting better he's still a kid and it's,11/19/2018,21
hard to be real consistent real good,11/19/2018,21
defensively and offensively every night,11/19/2018,21
a national league when your kid on the,11/19/2018,21
back end but I mean he made a real good,11/19/2018,21
play I mean obviously I wasn't the worst,11/19/2018,21
and she had it set up because I'm stuck,11/19/2018,21
the drawn and I'm going in that there,11/19/2018,21
for him so you know good play and a big,11/19/2018,21
goal obviously for us,11/19/2018,21
you always talk about starting on time,11/21/2018,22
like what negated the process here,11/21/2018,22
tonight boys think they were prepared,11/21/2018,22
and they worked and they were excited,11/21/2018,22
you know we talked about the processor,11/21/2018,22
today and being ready and we weren't,11/21/2018,22
anyway look if you don't when he battles,11/21/2018,22
any races is it done there my skill you,11/21/2018,22
have so I really thought in the end you,11/21/2018,22
know we had the game close we had,11/21/2018,22
opportunity even six on five and all,11/21/2018,22
that we had opportunity but in saying,11/21/2018,22
that is the right team one the team that,11/21/2018,22
started on time worked the Hearst in the,11/21/2018,22
end even though we turned the game and,11/21/2018,22
did all those things,11/21/2018,22
not enough guys in and not prepare,11/21/2018,22
worked tough game you know erases any,11/21/2018,22
battle so we weren't prepared to go for,11/21/2018,22
whatever reason I mean it's not like we,11/21/2018,22
didn't have a normal day with normal,11/21/2018,22
process and try to get prepared but we,11/21/2018,22
weren't prepared so we're gonna take a,11/21/2018,22
quick look at herself and get ready for,11/21/2018,22
the next one because nothing we can do,11/21/2018,22
to fix this one now no but the message,11/21/2018,22
is pretty clear if you don't work you,11/21/2018,22
don't win no I don't think so I mean you,11/21/2018,22
know I've gone through and calling them,11/21/2018,22
all here but there was just you got a,11/21/2018,22
playwright I didn't think it was any,11/21/2018,22
trouble in the second period when we,11/21/2018,22
were playing right so anyway bottom line,11/21/2018,22
is we didn't get what we wanted here,11/21/2018,22
today and ideally a good lesson for all,11/21/2018,22
of us we're not prepared we've got no,11/21/2018,22
chance to have success and,11/21/2018,22
it's Mike the beauty of the schedule is,11/23/2018,23
you get to do this all over again,11/23/2018,23
tomorrow with her parts of tonight's,11/23/2018,23
game you'd like to carry and at least,11/23/2018,23
the positive side obviously well I,11/23/2018,23
thought tonight that might be as good a,11/23/2018,23
role game we played in a while to be,11/23/2018,23
honest with you I thought when you look,11/23/2018,23
at this series with him probably ended,11/23/2018,23
the way it should we they should have,11/23/2018,23
won in her building we probably should,11/23/2018,23
have won in here but that's the way it,11/23/2018,23
goes I thought our guys skated good move,11/23/2018,23
puck we turned the puck over on the,11/23/2018,23
first goal then on their fourth cool and,11/23/2018,23
so you can't do that but the bottom line,11/23/2018,23
is we played heavy we played fast we had,11/23/2018,23
lots of good things now we got to just,11/23/2018,23
take the energy in the morning obviously,11/23/2018,23
Philly played today which is nice know,11/23/2018,23
their home watching our game and waiting,11/23/2018,23
for us but we'll get re-energized and,11/23/2018,23
ready for tomorrow I thought well I mean,11/23/2018,23
we had a tavares line dominating the,11/23/2018,23
game obviously I thought we had,11/23/2018,23
everybody on work tonight you know I,11/23/2018,23
said we had that turnover I think right,11/23/2018,23
away really took control the game and,11/23/2018,23
played really really well but we didn't,11/23/2018,23
score and they did and that's the way go,11/23/2018,23
some well I mean when you win a game and,11/23/2018,23
you steal it you don't think like idea,11/23/2018,23
so I guess you know I mean these things,11/23/2018,23
happen over I like the way we play if,11/23/2018,23
you do good things the process normally,11/23/2018,23
evens its way out,11/23/2018,23
I thought tonight's game was a real good,11/23/2018,23
bounce-back from our game in Carolina we,11/23/2018,23
didn't get what we wanted which is the,11/23/2018,23
two points and saying all that the,11/23/2018,23
process was good the work ethic was good,11/23/2018,23
and we did a lot of positive I thought,11/23/2018,23
that right there that short-handed goal,11/23/2018,23
was four on four and we never really got,11/23/2018,23
organized we tried to jam it in it and,11/23/2018,23
we got and then we we took her big group,11/23/2018,23
off and put her our second group on and,11/23/2018,23
they couldn't get organized so that was,11/23/2018,23
something we got it we had to do a,11/23/2018,23
better job of moving ahead we know that,11/23/2018,23
and understand that can't just get,11/23/2018,23
chances you got to get goals,11/23/2018,23
important was that the start the way you,11/24/2018,24
got it here tonight quickly and with,11/24/2018,24
speed,11/24/2018,24
yeah no obviously I thought played quick,11/24/2018,24
I mean real good for Johnny anytime,11/24/2018,24
you've been a real good player in the,11/24/2018,24
minors and then you come to a national,11/24/2018,24
leak and you know you're trying to find,11/24/2018,24
your way I think you got her in,11/24/2018,24
confidence and that would really help,11/24/2018,24
him here tonight so I was positive but I,11/24/2018,24
feel the guys dad and score got to score,11/24/2018,24
so I think that was a good thing yeah,11/24/2018,24
you know I hadn't thought about that,11/24/2018,24
part today I it's my assumption we're,11/24/2018,24
getting both back you know obviously,11/24/2018,24
we'll be a better hockey club when we,11/24/2018,24
have them both they give you a whole,11/24/2018,24
nother line and give you a much more,11/24/2018,24
depth and and you know ideally that's,11/24/2018,24
what you had in mind when you started,11/24/2018,24
the year so you know expected to have it,11/24/2018,24
a lot sooner than I have but we'll be,11/24/2018,24
excited to have them both,11/24/2018,24
yeah you're important when you're in the,11/24/2018,24
fourth line everybody is important on a,11/24/2018,24
team right all 23 people so that's the,11/24/2018,24
first thing the second thing is is is,11/24/2018,24
you're just learning the details of the,11/24/2018,24
game you're learning how big people are,11/24/2018,24
you don't know how to hold on the puck,11/24/2018,24
you learn how to stand up in traffic,11/24/2018,24
you're learning how to play in your own,11/24/2018,24
zone and you think you do but you find,11/24/2018,24
out when you get here you didn't have,11/24/2018,24
any details because the league didn't,11/24/2018,24
need the same kind of details because,11/24/2018,24
the players weren't as good so that's,11/24/2018,24
the biggest process for you and then,11/24/2018,24
everything about Liga and I've said this,11/24/2018,24
before teach your confidence the way the,11/24/2018,24
players do good and you never touch the,11/24/2018,24
puck and so but for Johnny tonight this,11/24/2018,24
is a big step now can he turn it into,11/24/2018,24
something and get some rhythm in his,11/24/2018,24
game and get going ideally you said that,11/24/2018,24
okay yeah you know I think the biggest,11/24/2018,24
problem with talking is you got to back,11/24/2018,24
that up then right and so I just the,11/24/2018,24
biggest thing I'd say to you is all,11/24/2018,24
these guys are trying to take steps so,11/24/2018,24
just no different than Johnny tonight,11/24/2018,24
anytime you get in the net and you find,11/24/2018,24
a way to play well and you find a way to,11/24/2018,24
win I think that's a step but I also,11/24/2018,24
think it's a process it's a hardly can,11/24/2018,24
we see goalies all the time how hard it,11/24/2018,24
is to survive in this league there's,11/24/2018,24
real shooters and it's tough on you,11/24/2018,24
mentally so the best thing you can do is,11/24/2018,24
enjoy tonight and get back to work,11/24/2018,24
tomorrow,11/24/2018,24
[Music],11/24/2018,24
well I don't think they're sensing it I,11/24/2018,24
think they know what you know they're,11/24/2018,24
smart dyes well I mean you know I,11/24/2018,24
thought we played well and then got away,11/24/2018,24
from and got back to it but you know,11/24/2018,24
tonight I mean ideally everyone salon,11/24/2018,24
when you need it you need a power play,11/24/2018,24
tonight to stab some rhythm off the,11/24/2018,24
bench too and you know there was not a,11/24/2018,24
whole bunch going on to call panel news,11/24/2018,24
about tonight,11/24/2018,24
total team victory Mike in terms of,11/26/2018,25
everyone yeah I thought you know I,11/26/2018,25
thought the honestly I thought we got,11/26/2018,25
off to a good start I thought were,11/26/2018,25
playing good I thought they were better,11/26/2018,25
than us in the second period especially,11/26/2018,25
in the first 50 minutes had two power,11/26/2018,25
plays were we couldn't clear the puck we,11/26/2018,25
had multiple opportunities to and we,11/26/2018,25
didn't and then they scored they didn't,11/26/2018,25
score on the second one but I mean they,11/26/2018,25
could have easy scored and I thought it,11/26/2018,25
took us a while to kind of recover after,11/26/2018,25
that and get playing the way we were,11/26/2018,25
cooked and and then you know I thought,11/26/2018,25
the third period was pretty even but the,11/26/2018,25
power plays I mean obviously we scored,11/26/2018,25
on the power play but they're powerful,11/26/2018,25
it was very dangerous the two times they,11/26/2018,25
had it there in the second and I thought,11/26/2018,25
that's when they tilted the game and had,11/26/2018,25
it going their way,11/26/2018,25
well I think that's what you think with,11/26/2018,25
all good players is not you know I think,11/26/2018,25
if you're watching them I think you,11/26/2018,25
think when 88 gets the puck he's playing,11/26/2018,25
a different game than everybody else -,11/26/2018,25
good what's amazing as most of us have,11/26/2018,25
no time in space whatsoever we're,11/26/2018,25
banging it here and banging it there and,11/26/2018,25
chasing it and then the really good guy,11/26/2018,25
seemed to have all the time in the world,11/26/2018,25
and that's what you're talking about,11/26/2018,25
that's why they're just they're gliding,11/26/2018,25
all over the rink and it seems,11/26/2018,25
effortless and it seems like fun and,11/26/2018,25
they have the puck all the time and you,11/26/2018,25
can't figure out why but they're just,11/26/2018,25
better than your bails,11/26/2018,25
well I mean the goals I mean nice for,11/26/2018,25
the kid they've got a goal and all that,11/26/2018,25
but what I like about it means the elite,11/26/2018,25
passer and he's a great big body he's,11/26/2018,25
gonna become a really good penalty,11/26/2018,25
killer for you no one can crack his,11/26/2018,25
wrists and clear the puck we haven't,11/26/2018,25
played him in that situation at all but,11/26/2018,25
we think he can become that you know the,11/26/2018,25
biggest thing when you come from the big,11/26/2018,25
ice,11/26/2018,25
the little ice is everything so much,11/26/2018,25
quicker you got used to it but he can,11/26/2018,25
really shoot the puck he hasn't showed,11/26/2018,25
that yet but he can pass it and he's not,11/26/2018,25
afraid he can take the hit and make the,11/26/2018,25
play at the same time to me that's where,11/26/2018,25
he's kind of separated himself yeah I,11/26/2018,25
mean you know it's like anything you're,11/26/2018,25
what you're trying to do is you're,11/26/2018,25
trying to get to be really deep and if,11/26/2018,25
you're gonna have success in the end,11/26/2018,25
it's not going to be about one line the,11/26/2018,25
one line teams are always out of the,11/26/2018,25
playoffs it's gonna be about having four,11/26/2018,25
lines and 60 and maybe 8d that can play,11/26/2018,25
and so that's our goal is to build,11/26/2018,25
players as your goes on you have to,11/26/2018,25
stick with the process and the process,11/26/2018,25
allows you to win in the mean time but,11/26/2018,25
you got to develop players got to find,11/26/2018,25
players and every time someone gets hurt,11/26/2018,25
or was not here someone else gets an,11/26/2018,25
opportunity and I think that's what,11/26/2018,25
you're seeing with our group and ideally,11/26/2018,25
we'll end up deeper,11/26/2018,25
is on the bench and off how do you like,11/28/2018,26
your team's effort in terms of,11/28/2018,26
contributing to all the offense we saw,11/28/2018,26
here tonight yeah I thought we loved we,11/28/2018,26
obviously scored goals I didn't I don't,11/28/2018,26
know if we skated as good as we normally,11/28/2018,26
skate to be honest with you you know we,11/28/2018,26
I don't know when the last time we had a,11/28/2018,26
real practice and ever since we came,11/28/2018,26
back from the west coast I don't know if,11/28/2018,26
Lee skated as good as we can yet we have,11/28/2018,26
good players we found a way to play good,11/28/2018,26
nothing and when and you know a big win,11/28/2018,26
for us against a good team well because,11/28/2018,26
I wanted to match nas his unit against,11/28/2018,26
Pavelski and I just thought would marvel,11/28/2018,26
there that gave me know a model can help,11/28/2018,26
Maddie to but I thought I was gonna give,11/28/2018,26
Maddie a easier matchup tonight and and,11/28/2018,26
go that way so I thought that gave us,11/28/2018,26
the best and thank you you'll see more,11/28/2018,26
rotation once we get everyone back once,11/28/2018,26
we get Willie to I think you'll see more,11/28/2018,26
rotation just because it it doesn't,11/28/2018,26
really matter as much that makes any,11/28/2018,26
sense well you know I was just looking,11/28/2018,26
at your minor played 18 30 24 chefs 46,11/28/2018,26
seconds and he played one shift less and,11/28/2018,26
played right here was it say Matthew 14,11/28/2018,26
56 over 38 so obviously he was getting,11/28/2018,26
on and off the ice right you know so but,11/28/2018,26
he should be too you know your first,11/28/2018,26
couple games to get yourself corn I,11/28/2018,26
don't know if he's gonna go this way for,11/28/2018,26
a bit or if he can maintain a Baathist,11/28/2018,26
he's a real talented guy big guy smart,11/28/2018,26
guy and was good for us,11/28/2018,26
you don't even have Lilian you have guys,11/28/2018,26
like NASA marvel on the third line,11/28/2018,26
albeit just for tonight but is that what,11/28/2018,26
you've been talking about the whole time,11/28/2018,26
well we want to think he when you saw it,11/28/2018,26
last year in the spring we lost in the,11/28/2018,26
first round the team that beat us lost,11/28/2018,26
in the next round yeah you know when the,11/28/2018,26
team to beat them lost to they if you,11/28/2018,26
want to play four rounds you got to have,11/28/2018,26
lots of depth and real good players and,11/28/2018,26
so that's we're trying to create here,11/28/2018,26
the best Kent the guys have been given,11/28/2018,26
real good opportunity like theirs,11/28/2018,26
I mean we've had 12 four it's all your,11/28/2018,26
basically so they've been given a real,11/28/2018,26
good opportunity state a case for,11/28/2018,26
themselves and then as we get people,11/28/2018,26
back obviously things will change,11/28/2018,26
[Music],11/28/2018,26
yeah I never saw what you're seeing,11/28/2018,26
tonight but I mean you know I'd have to,11/28/2018,26
think about I don't know for sure I mean,11/28/2018,26
I think we can place so much faster than,11/28/2018,26
we're playing right now and I think,11/28/2018,26
we're going to you know we got to get,11/28/2018,26
practice in a little bit here and get,11/28/2018,26
her legs back and get jumping but,11/28/2018,26
obviously when we get everyone on deck,11/28/2018,26
will be a quick team I mean Willie can,11/28/2018,26
fly too so he was quick oh we're we're,11/28/2018,26
giving it to him pretty good,11/28/2018,26
your reactions to getting the player you,12/1/2018,27
said the team would sign and of course,12/1/2018,27
the ability to bend but not break well I,12/1/2018,27
thought you know obviously was good news,12/1/2018,27
for our Aki Club here today Kyle and,12/1/2018,27
Prince and the guys did a real good job,12/1/2018,27
getting that done I know I wouldn't have,12/1/2018,27
the patience for that kind of thing,12/1/2018,27
myself so it's good they were able to do,12/1/2018,27
it and you know Willie was ecstatic just,12/1/2018,27
in after obviously wants to be back here,12/1/2018,27
and and we want him back here so take us,12/1/2018,27
I don't know four or five days to get,12/1/2018,27
him in the lineup but then as soon as we,12/1/2018,27
can we'll get him in,12/1/2018,27
as far as tonight I thought we started,12/1/2018,27
okay and then I think I don't know if we,12/1/2018,27
thought it was going to be easy or,12/1/2018,27
whatever and then they're a big heavy,12/1/2018,27
team that play roast on in the neutral,12/1/2018,27
zone would turn the puck over and and,12/1/2018,27
they made in a hockey game and we were,12/1/2018,27
resilient and found a way to win well I,12/1/2018,27
mean he's competitive right and you know,12/1/2018,27
I thought the the break-up play from,12/1/2018,27
guards to Mitchie in the play there when,12/1/2018,27
shoots the backside and that was a great,12/1/2018,27
play by him there and then that play is,12/1/2018,27
another big play for us so you know good,12/1/2018,27
for him and good for our team we're,12/1/2018,27
gonna end up as a team with lots of,12/1/2018,27
depth and we're gonna end up becoming a,12/1/2018,27
real good hockey club I didn't think we,12/1/2018,27
had our im at all in the second half,12/1/2018,27
of the game and yet we found a way to,12/1/2018,27
win that son a good team you were to,12/1/2018,27
judge the way we scored yes so the big,12/1/2018,27
goal at the end of giving her two game,12/1/2018,27
strips was like that the goal by hymen,12/1/2018,27
was like that are the go-ahead goal and,12/1/2018,27
then the goal by I meant was like that,12/1/2018,27
we we should play them 20 times worn in,12/1/2018,27
the playoffs you know we got to make the,12/1/2018,27
playoffs but we need to understand how,12/1/2018,27
heavy and how hard it is and we're fun,12/1/2018,27
to watch there's no question well but,12/1/2018,27
just cuz you're fun to watch doesn't,12/1/2018,27
mean you get to play a long time in the,12/1/2018,27
spring 12 and 3 went out shot by an,12/1/2018,27
opponent a lot of this aren't Freddie,12/1/2018,27
are you not that concern that maybe some,12/1/2018,27
of those shots aren't the quality that,12/1/2018,27
they could well we we track scored,12/1/2018,27
like crazy so when they're not we talk,12/1/2018,27
about that when there's too many scoring,12/1/2018,27
chances you know that's on us tonight,12/1/2018,27
there was too many scoring chances,12/1/2018,27
where do you what do you take from all,12/4/2018,28
of this whether it be resilience the,12/4/2018,28
ability to come back Austin and,12/4/2018,28
everything well your sub we found a way,12/4/2018,28
I you know what to start of the game,12/4/2018,28
they were quicker than us for whatever,12/4/2018,28
reason and then I thought we got a dolly,12/4/2018,28
and I thought we really took over the,12/4/2018,28
start of the second period that's kind,12/4/2018,28
of seven minutes of the first and,12/4/2018,28
started a second period and had the game,12/4/2018,28
you know in a good spot we in my opinion,12/4/2018,28
you know would turn the puck over full,12/4/2018,28
roll awesome face offs on another two,12/4/2018,28
but all in all we found a way to win,12/4/2018,28
obviously good players do good things,12/4/2018,28
Cappy had a real good chance there are,12/4/2018,28
no overtime as well and going mean a,12/4/2018,28
real good Savin yeah I mean you know if,12/4/2018,28
you know I'm and and I don't want to,12/4/2018,28
take anything away you got two goals,12/4/2018,28
tonight so but obviously is skating is,12/4/2018,28
conditioning there or there's nothing,12/4/2018,28
you can do I mean you're not going until,12/4/2018,28
you play some but the more he plays the,12/4/2018,28
more he gets through it the better he's,12/4/2018,28
gonna be and they're just that ability,12/4/2018,28
to keep pushing when you're in a battle,12/4/2018,28
it's tough and the ability to keep your,12/4/2018,28
legs going so anytime you've been off,12/4/2018,28
it's it's gonna take you some time and,12/4/2018,28
he knows that but he's good enough fire,12/4/2018,28
that he obviously is helping us in the,12/4/2018,28
meantime,12/4/2018,28
well I agree with you but I think if if,12/4/2018,28
you talked to him and just Alison,12/4/2018,28
specifically there's probably a number,12/4/2018,28
of times right now that he probably,12/4/2018,28
feels that a gas but you know what it is,12/4/2018,28
and then over time he can't get off,12/4/2018,28
anyway and then by the time it was he,12/4/2018,28
had a chance to get off there was about,12/4/2018,28
10 seconds left so or whatever it was so,12/4/2018,28
shot it in the United States always got,12/4/2018,28
a good release obviously you know I'd,12/4/2018,28
have to go through the game and Wow,12/4/2018,28
since I coached anybody I could shoot,12/4/2018,28
the puck like that but even shoot the,12/4/2018,28
puck not sure if you're aware of this,12/4/2018,28
but the Leafs have gotten the 20 wins,12/4/2018,28
to match the the fewest games to get to,12/4/2018,28
20 wins in franchise history,12/4/2018,28
last time it happens just 1934-35 does,12/4/2018,28
that mean anything to you I mean just,12/4/2018,28
means a lot to me one day I'm gonna,12/4/2018,28
retire and one day someone's gonna show,12/4/2018,28
me a sheet with all this stuff on it no,12/4/2018,28
I mean it's we're out the gate looks,12/4/2018,28
like Tampa wins every night to me were,12/4/2018,28
in real battle here with Buffalo you're,12/4/2018,28
in a battle to get better and you're in,12/4/2018,28
a battle for the standings at the same,12/4/2018,28
time but the way that division is it's,12/4/2018,28
going to be real tight all year it's,12/4/2018,28
going to be a lot of fun I think it's,12/4/2018,28
great I mean obviously we got a good,12/4/2018,28
team and we've got good young players,12/4/2018,28
and we think we're going in the right,12/4/2018,28
direction it's my fourth year in Toronto,12/4/2018,28
and it's gotten better every year and,12/4/2018,28
we're excited about our opportunity now,12/4/2018,28
we still got to get a lot better to get,12/4/2018,28
to do what we want to do so 20 games is,12/4/2018,28
great but you know we a lot of work,12/4/2018,28
today well that was real good I mean,12/4/2018,28
Hyman went to Lynette and tied up,12/4/2018,28
Bogosian so he couldn't play and then,12/4/2018,28
the other two basically two-on-one,12/4/2018,28
at the end Mitch's got that kind of,12/4/2018,28
ability the good players seem to keep,12/4/2018,28
making plays over and over or else,12/4/2018,28
there's no room for the rest of us but,12/4/2018,28
for the those few guys they seem to,12/4/2018,28
build well I think it is I mean I think,12/4/2018,28
you work Maddie and him teammates at one,12/4/2018,28
time you know and I think it was,12/4/2018,28
personal I think that's that's what you,12/4/2018,28
want you want best on best I mean you,12/4/2018,28
know I think in all sport at the highest,12/4/2018,28
level best on best that is personal well,12/4/2018,28
not many of them are 225 pounds or,12/4/2018,28
whatever he is,12/4/2018,28
and then obviously he's got a gift and,12/4/2018,28
yet an insane not what we try to do is,12/4/2018,28
we try to steal something good off all,12/4/2018,28
the really good parts and you know,12/4/2018,28
whatever that may be you can always,12/4/2018,28
learn from what the good players do and,12/4/2018,28
you try to turn it give it to your,12/4/2018,28
development team and see if we can't all,12/4/2018,28
do something better well and that's what,12/4/2018,28
happens when you got really good players,12/4/2018,28
you're gonna learn from him who will,12/4/2018,28
he's gonna come back now and you're,12/4/2018,28
gonna see some things he can do and,12/4/2018,28
things Mitch can do and so then you know,12/4/2018,28
when we're sending out clips this summer,12/4/2018,28
we're sending out clips of the way Riley,12/4/2018,28
can turn in the way he puts his stick,12/4/2018,28
down and the way Mitch can do things to,12/4/2018,28
other kids because we want them to,12/4/2018,28
follow that lead Barbie,12/4/2018,28
Oh Willie you'll practice idea I hope,12/4/2018,28
he's playing enough is enough let's get,12/4/2018,28
out of here man,12/4/2018,28
this is the NHL in the Red Wings and,12/6/2018,29
anything is great if you get behind as,12/6/2018,29
much as you did as early as you did it,12/6/2018,29
so it's a long way up hill,12/6/2018,29
oh I mean they they were just better,12/6/2018,29
than us the game greatest thing about,12/6/2018,29
the game I say this all the time it's,12/6/2018,29
still honest and so they played harder,12/6/2018,29
to they were better and you know I,12/6/2018,29
thought we did a real good job to get,12/6/2018,29
ourselves a point I don't think we,12/6/2018,29
deserved to it was great that we got one,12/6/2018,29
but we didn't have enough hands on deck,12/6/2018,29
and we didn't work,12/6/2018,29
I thought Willie was fine it's probably,12/6/2018,29
unfair for me you know we were we had,12/6/2018,29
the bus thing that happened we were,12/6/2018,29
supposed to practice together we never,12/6/2018,29
even gave the guy a practice we wanted,12/6/2018,29
to get him in and he got two guys on,12/6/2018,29
that line that are just one coming back,12/6/2018,29
from injury and one who I was in plate,12/6/2018,29
and so in the end I mean it was it we,12/6/2018,29
had an opportunity we felt to get going,12/6/2018,29
we tried to get going has nothing to do,12/6/2018,29
with Willie has to do with me and trying,12/6/2018,29
to win the game you know I want him to,12/6/2018,29
play a ton I just want to get him out,12/6/2018,29
there get up going but you know it's,12/6/2018,29
anytime you've missed the amount of,12/6/2018,29
hockey that's good it's gonna be hard,12/6/2018,29
for him but you know what talk to Matty,12/6/2018,29
about that too is they're both gonna,12/6/2018,29
have to do extra we're gonna do it every,12/6/2018,29
practice day and they'll crawl the way,12/6/2018,29
back to being the players were capable,12/6/2018,29
of being well I mean you know it's a,12/6/2018,29
national oculi we expect everyone would,12/6/2018,29
be good every night that's just the way,12/6/2018,29
we are and as the coach you look at,12/6/2018,29
yourself well after a game like that we,12/6/2018,29
weren't ready to go,12/6/2018,29
so that's on me his games on him we're,12/6/2018,29
all responsible and the way you fix,12/6/2018,29
things is when you own it so you all say,12/6/2018,29
it's it's on you and then as long as you,12/6/2018,29
do that everything gets fixed,12/6/2018,29
well when I saw the replay I was back,12/6/2018,29
yet and I thought it might be a little,12/6/2018,29
sore tomorrow but at least it wasn't his,12/6/2018,29
shoulder that's what I thought earlier,12/6/2018,29
since I saw well the onsen captain we're,12/6/2018,29
best players so and you know Himes works,12/6/2018,29
every night but the idea is we're trying,12/6/2018,29
to build a program that were really deep,12/6/2018,29
and but I think in the NHL if you don't,12/6/2018,29
get prepared for your opponent it,12/6/2018,29
doesn't matter who you're playing that,12/6/2018,29
team came in here they were gonna work,12/6/2018,29
hard they knew they were playing a good,12/6/2018,29
team we weren't prepared and they chose,12/6/2018,29
so you know what's fair that way,12/6/2018,29
Amahl,12/6/2018,29
no I don't think so at all you know it's,12/6/2018,29
gonna be I mean no one's gonna play 25,12/6/2018,29
minutes up front that's what they want,12/6/2018,29
they have to play in a team with way,12/6/2018,29
less players but in the end we all want,12/6/2018,29
the same thing we want to win and have a,12/6/2018,29
lot of success long term so you know,12/6/2018,29
we're gonna find a way to make it go I,12/6/2018,29
think initially when you change your,12/6/2018,29
lineup when someone gets hurt it's never,12/6/2018,29
quite as smooth for the first couple as,12/6/2018,29
it is over a period of time you just,12/6/2018,29
figure it all out,12/6/2018,29
that's all do well I mean obviously it's,12/6/2018,29
got skill you know on a few regroups in,12/6/2018,29
that but yeah in open ice you have that,12/6/2018,29
but in the bottles you don't have any,12/6/2018,29
juice you just you have been in one so,12/6/2018,29
you guys have a good night,12/6/2018,29
no for sure I actually stopped we,12/8/2018,30
started really good here tonight we came,12/8/2018,30
out we were on top of him give up a,12/8/2018,30
four-on-four goal and then I didn't,12/8/2018,30
think we were very good or competitive,12/8/2018,30
in the second period and obviously the,12/8/2018,30
second Pyrrhus did us in and you know,12/8/2018,30
what's disappointing I thought we're,12/8/2018,30
gonna come in here and play real well,12/8/2018,30
especially after the night at home but,12/8/2018,30
obviously we didn't we're gonna have to,12/8/2018,30
get ourselves regroup we just had a real,12/8/2018,30
good run where we got you know five wins,12/8/2018,30
and an overtime loss or not yeah I think,12/8/2018,30
that's what was and now we got to,12/8/2018,30
regroup so every once in a while you get,12/8/2018,30
fed your lunch today it was one of those,12/8/2018,30
days,12/8/2018,30
get yourself regroup and get back out or,12/8/2018,30
we got a day off tomorrow and good,12/8/2018,30
practice to employ Carolina well I mean,12/8/2018,30
you'd like to win every game on the,12/8/2018,30
schedule but you and I both know we've,12/8/2018,30
been around long enough you don't do,12/8/2018,30
that,12/8/2018,30
so you want your ups to be longer your,12/8/2018,30
downs and sometimes we don't play as,12/8/2018,30
good it's a good message do you gotta be,12/8/2018,30
a lot better so I think you got to be a,12/8/2018,30
lot more competitive than we were in the,12/8/2018,30
last two nights so it's great that we,12/8/2018,30
had a good little run there and now we,12/8/2018,30
got to regroup and have another one well,12/8/2018,30
just not this what I talked about I,12/8/2018,30
think you can look at our whole group I,12/8/2018,30
didn't think you know we're good enough,12/8/2018,30
and so you're all in it together and,12/8/2018,30
some nights lines pick you up another,12/8/2018,30
guys you know maybe not have as good a,12/8/2018,30
night tonight we didn't have anyone else,12/8/2018,30
to pick us up starting with Nasim's,12/8/2018,30
fight did you like the way your club at,12/8/2018,30
least pushed back and showed some,12/8/2018,30
personality there well I mean obviously,12/8/2018,30
there was some hits in tonight's game,12/8/2018,30
that I mean could have been called or,12/8/2018,30
whatever you want to say but you know I,12/8/2018,30
thought I'd guess throw ball for,12/8/2018,30
themselves and and obviously I think we,12/8/2018,30
will get these guys a couple more times,12/8/2018,30
this year if I'm not mistaken so it,12/8/2018,30
should be fun,12/8/2018,30
you appreciate about attention to detail,12/11/2018,31
here tonight that led to the victory,12/11/2018,31
Mike well that we started real good,12/11/2018,31
obviously came out and played and good,12/11/2018,31
golfer andis from the goat there Jeremy,12/11/2018,31
so I thought that was a good start for,12/11/2018,31
us you know we have real good finally,12/11/2018,31
killed her tonight I didn't like the way,12/11/2018,31
he finished as much just because give up,12/11/2018,31
some chances we didn't need to but good,12/11/2018,31
win for our team and I said earlier,12/11/2018,31
today the mums were all there watching,12/11/2018,31
them so I was good to they got to see,12/11/2018,31
that and then they can come on the trip,12/11/2018,31
well for sure it's gonna take them time,12/11/2018,31
though I mean let's yeah they're all,12/11/2018,31
fine as long as the ice is open but as,12/11/2018,31
soon as it's in contact and you got to,12/11/2018,31
keep your legs going you get stuck out,12/11/2018,31
in a shift to propel only the one time,12/11/2018,31
that's the goat in the ship that just,12/11/2018,31
it's hard for you and it's gonna take,12/11/2018,31
some time so we'll be patient - he s not,12/11/2018,31
really what we're doing is we'll just,12/11/2018,31
once it gets up to speed well we're,12/11/2018,31
gonna worry about it more I guess in the,12/11/2018,31
meantime though you know we we want our,12/11/2018,31
power play to be deadly wasn't is about,12/11/2018,31
weight tonight but we're gonna need it,12/11/2018,31
to be like that if we're gonna have,12/11/2018,31
success he didn't run plenty of time in,12/11/2018,31
that four-minute penalty kill what's a,12/11/2018,31
kill like that do for a bench that's,12/11/2018,31
watching on us you guys try to establish,12/11/2018,31
tempo early well obviously you know,12/11/2018,31
you're up here in a good situation,12/11/2018,31
suddenly you get a four-minute order the,12/11/2018,31
Willy stick card and you need to kill,12/11/2018,31
and we give up one tonight we didn't,12/11/2018,31
need to our kills got or become a,12/11/2018,31
dominant domina kill we thought we got,12/11/2018,31
off to a real good start on the kill,12/11/2018,31
hasn't been as good leap we need it back,12/11/2018,31
thought it would be like three games and,12/11/2018,31
after being off for so long and joining,12/11/2018,31
a club that's quick and good yeah I mean,12/11/2018,31
we knew it was gonna take some time for,12/11/2018,31
sure,12/11/2018,31
you know I actually spent time with,12/11/2018,31
Germany Sports Science Guy tonight,12/11/2018,31
trying to figure out just in training,12/11/2018,31
camp when you've trained all summer and,12/11/2018,31
you come back how many days it takes you,12/11/2018,31
to get your heart and all that level so,12/11/2018,31
we're working on that tonight to figure,12/11/2018,31
that out and it's not as quick as you'd,12/11/2018,31
like to think so,12/11/2018,31
well we just we did it today when,12/11/2018,31
everyone's through it at 12 days before,12/11/2018,31
it levels out after training campus work,12/11/2018,31
so you think about that you're in shape,12/11/2018,31
you've trained you're ready to go you've,12/11/2018,31
been with the team for a month basically,12/11/2018,31
so sometime,12/11/2018,31
you see enough quality chances from your,12/13/2018,32
club here tonight Mike that maybe on,12/13/2018,32
another night well obviously we we had,12/13/2018,32
lots opportunity here tonight no,12/13/2018,32
question there goaltender was real good,12/13/2018,32
you know we had good opportunity on a,12/13/2018,32
power play we didn't finish and then we,12/13/2018,32
made the mistake got beat to our net,12/13/2018,32
they're on their third goal and we turn,12/13/2018,32
it over on their fourth so I got us out,12/13/2018,32
of the game which disappointed because,12/13/2018,32
we thought we did lots of good things,12/13/2018,32
well I just thought it was a perfect,12/13/2018,32
time to do it the fourth line being on,12/13/2018,32
the ice had nothing to do with the goal,12/13/2018,32
going in though like I don't know if you,12/13/2018,32
saw that that's in the D that turned it,12/13/2018,32
over convert tonight because it just a,12/13/2018,32
matter of us Leslie playing oh geez the,12/13/2018,32
opportunity tears well I thought their,12/13/2018,32
goalie played good I don't know if you,12/13/2018,32
guys saw the same thing we thought their,12/13/2018,32
goalie played really well tonight we had,12/13/2018,32
thought we had good chances I haven't,12/13/2018,32
gone over everything on their tape the,12/13/2018,32
past came across a few times we bobbled,12/13/2018,32
it once they were going in the network I,12/13/2018,32
liked their effort tonight to be with me,12/13/2018,32
yeah I mean I think you come in here you,12/13/2018,32
never know if you're in a spot to play,12/13/2018,32
with the good teams until your plan I,12/13/2018,32
thought we had a good accountable so I,12/13/2018,32
mean obviously the scores disappointing,12/13/2018,32
but the way we play is not one bit,12/13/2018,32
disappointed a must like the way they,12/13/2018,32
were skating and taking it to them,12/13/2018,32
yeah and saying that we we gave up some,12/13/2018,32
power plays too and so you know I mean,12/13/2018,32
there's two good teams going fast who's,12/13/2018,32
gonna be mistakes but all know when you,12/13/2018,32
look at our effort I thought we did lots,12/13/2018,32
of good things well I mean we spent a,12/13/2018,32
ton of time in the offensive zone we,12/13/2018,32
rolled around good in your zone we,12/13/2018,32
weren't hemmed in an Arizona very often,12/13/2018,32
wall tonight,12/13/2018,32
we executed good like I said turn the,12/13/2018,32
puck over on that fourth one and we,12/13/2018,32
really didn't I mean we could have beat,12/13/2018,32
her guy to the net on the third one,12/13/2018,32
those those were the only things for me,12/13/2018,32
that stand up give me good things with,12/13/2018,32
these losses one difficulty digesters,12/13/2018,32
almost,12/13/2018,32
no I'd rather I like playing good I mean,12/13/2018,32
the league adds up wins or losses but,12/13/2018,32
the bottom line is you stay with the,12/13/2018,32
process and you do good things good,12/13/2018,32
things happen over time some nights it,12/13/2018,32
doesn't go your wig get all of it more,12/13/2018,32
good Clips per me more good more good,12/13/2018,32
examples of things Abed,12/13/2018,32
well I mean I don't know what I might,12/13/2018,32
have been on a different game than you,12/13/2018,32
guys look I mean with puck that must be,12/13/2018,32
pissed about it see you guys,12/13/2018,32
how do you balance what happened is the,12/15/2018,33
last 10 to 15 minutes as opposed to what,12/15/2018,33
you saw leading up to that that,12/15/2018,33
eventually got your team to overtime,12/15/2018,33
well the first two periods weren't good,12/15/2018,33
enough you know they're especially teams,12/15/2018,33
were better than our specialty teams,12/15/2018,33
more good enough then I I mean the third,12/15/2018,33
period obviously would took over and and,12/15/2018,33
really got to work you know the bottom,12/15/2018,33
line is every ready to play every night,12/15/2018,33
in the league and you play lots of games,12/15/2018,33
so some nights or not you got to find a,12/15/2018,33
way to respond and find a way to win and,12/15/2018,33
we got ourselves set up there and this,12/15/2018,33
never got it done in the end obviously,12/15/2018,33
birkoff was the best player on the ice,12/15/2018,33
by 10 miles their team was desperate,12/15/2018,33
that and one in a while and played real,12/15/2018,33
desperate and our our desperation didn't,12/15/2018,33
match her skill level well I thought the,12/15/2018,33
penalty kill actually we went down we,12/15/2018,33
got the little blue line we tried toe,12/15/2018,33
dragging someone and then finish the,12/15/2018,33
check so that would probably be part of,12/15/2018,33
it I thought apparently killing the,12/15/2018,33
first was really good until that last,12/15/2018,33
little play and then they just shot it,12/15/2018,33
biased from the half wall so to me that,12/15/2018,33
wasn't the scheme thing just shot it,12/15/2018,33
past us and then our power play the last,12/15/2018,33
couple of games obviously looks like the,12/15/2018,33
guys are a little frustrated to take a,12/15/2018,33
deep breath and they're allowed to work,12/15/2018,33
harder against you take the play that's,12/15/2018,33
given we're not making good decisions,12/15/2018,33
right now but you know we had lots of,12/15/2018,33
chances in temp we didn't have lots of,12/15/2018,33
tight they clogged it up good and,12/15/2018,33
birkoff on all the face offs we spent a,12/15/2018,33
lot of time breaking off I haven't seen,12/15/2018,33
it does me no good to comment down on,12/15/2018,33
either you know the legal look at if,12/15/2018,33
it's dirty I guess that's what they paid,12/15/2018,33
to do well we're going home I mean I,12/15/2018,33
don't think bras love any means I think,12/15/2018,33
morale has been great I think the trade,12/15/2018,33
of their players real good we didn't,12/15/2018,33
play hurt now that's I don't think we,12/15/2018,33
have any morale issue whatsoever I mean,12/15/2018,33
we were down and we're gonna get any,12/15/2018,33
points we found a way to buy back which,12/15/2018,33
is a real positive thing we actually had,12/15/2018,33
to do it twice which is a real positive,12/15/2018,33
thing what I don't like is that we,12/15/2018,33
didn't play our,12/15/2018,33
speech you know I yeah I mean I don't I,12/15/2018,33
didn't I can't tell you the answer lad I,12/15/2018,33
don't sit your come walk out listen say,12/15/2018,33
jeez yeah the wheels are off here I,12/15/2018,33
don't see that at all,12/15/2018,33
weren't good enough that's it didn't,12/15/2018,33
play hard enough like before the game,12/15/2018,33
well 200 foot clears face offs and just,12/15/2018,33
sticking to the scheme but I I don't,12/15/2018,33
disagree with him hasn't been as good as,12/15/2018,33
it was it was on fire and then hasn't,12/15/2018,33
been as good and so words of stuff to,12/15/2018,33
get back at it but I think you go,12/15/2018,33
through abs and floors each year and,12/15/2018,33
let's just keep steady on the rudder and,12/15/2018,33
let's just keep going and find ways to,12/15/2018,33
improve but tonight and in Tampa I,12/15/2018,33
repentantly kill I mean was unbelievable,12/15/2018,33
in tempo gave up the one shot and he,12/15/2018,33
scored and then tonight I thought the,12/15/2018,33
same thing on that first one's a gift,12/15/2018,33
drive me crazy,12/15/2018,33
did you like the way your club was able,12/18/2018,34
to build on the third period we saw in,12/18/2018,34
Florida the other night and extended,12/18/2018,34
here tonight for the better part of 60,12/18/2018,34
yeah I thought we started good tonight,12/18/2018,34
you know I don't know if we've,12/18/2018,34
maintained it through 60 but we really,12/18/2018,34
started good came out got on the cycle,12/18/2018,34
and scored some big goals and we're at,12/18/2018,34
the net for the first three you know so,12/18/2018,34
it's a good win for our team and you,12/18/2018,34
know we gotta get their historic,12/18/2018,34
perspective of what Patrick accomplished,12/18/2018,34
here tonight he's keeping on moving but,12/18/2018,34
it is testament to what he's done that's,12/18/2018,34
incredible actually just even think,12/18/2018,34
about it you know other things that were,12/18/2018,34
positive tonight browning it three,12/18/2018,34
assists so that was great and so getting,12/18/2018,34
a couple of goals all those things for,12/18/2018,34
confidence are great for people I just,12/18/2018,34
think that for him is just feeling good,12/18/2018,34
about himself we're able to get those,12/18/2018,34
guys on the ice born here tonight and,12/18/2018,34
they were able to make a better,12/18/2018,34
contribution well you think we got good,12/18/2018,34
team depth so if we play right we'll,12/18/2018,34
give yourself an opportunity on most,12/18/2018,34
nights so you know we feel fortunate,12/18/2018,34
about that,12/18/2018,34
well I thought that one I thought the,12/18/2018,34
first one he drove the net to I don't,12/18/2018,34
know if we got a point on that one,12/18/2018,34
either yeah I think you got an assist on,12/18/2018,34
but he drove the guy back and then I,12/18/2018,34
thought our models goal too is physical,12/18/2018,34
on the forecheck and then physical not,12/18/2018,34
front for others right that's why I said,12/18/2018,34
I really liked her Stern well I mean,12/18/2018,34
he's gotten way better as sticking his,12/18/2018,34
feet in the diesel and his defense,12/18/2018,34
awareness way better,12/18/2018,34
I think getting around haensi here has,12/18/2018,34
really helped in that way and obviously,12/18/2018,34
he's got a good growth and then we all,12/18/2018,34
knew he was good offensively but the,12/18/2018,34
defensive part as many huge difference,12/18/2018,34
yeah I mean he's done a good job he's,12/18/2018,34
good player he skates really well it,12/18/2018,34
would be his greatest asset for sure,12/18/2018,34
he's competitive got lots an urgent,12/18/2018,34
Morgan just talked about the club's work,12/20/2018,35
ethic in terms of the power play and,12/20/2018,35
working through the drug what have you,12/20/2018,35
seen along the way that enabled them to,12/20/2018,35
be as proficient as they were to make,12/20/2018,35
money well I just thought you know,12/20/2018,35
things were going fine when in the Tampa,12/20/2018,35
and you know the goalie made tons of,12/20/2018,35
saves we hit some bars and then we,12/20/2018,35
seemed to start pressing after that and,12/20/2018,35
and today we just did things right next,12/20/2018,35
secured and as soon as they got one they,12/20/2018,35
were going to get more I thought her,12/20/2018,35
team worked hard tonight those starting,12/20/2018,35
on time you know well I mean obviously,12/20/2018,35
if you make good plays it's hard to,12/20/2018,35
defend right and you know for a while,12/20/2018,35
there we weren't seen it or moving it,12/20/2018,35
yeah as we pressed and then you know,12/20/2018,35
once we got one it was obvious just the,12/20/2018,35
difference in the tempo of our power,12/20/2018,35
play than what it had been here in the,12/20/2018,35
last week what's you know that's,12/20/2018,35
obviously unfortunate we didn't think we,12/20/2018,35
didn't know for sure time because he,12/20/2018,35
doesn't complain about nothing and he,12/20/2018,35
kept playing anyway you got the slewfoot,12/20/2018,35
there in jersey and you know went in the,12/20/2018,35
boards and then hurt his ankle and kept,12/20/2018,35
playing and then we thought that he,12/20/2018,35
tried to go today,12/20/2018,35
and we thought you know it was playing,12/20/2018,35
today and then obviously but it you know,12/20/2018,35
it's like anything you get an,12/20/2018,35
opportunity for someone else he's a real,12/20/2018,35
important part of our teams because he's,12/20/2018,35
so heavy we don't have enough heavy guys,12/20/2018,35
and he's one of those guys and so you,12/20/2018,35
know that hurts us that way to be heavy,12/20/2018,35
in the offensive zone but someone else,12/20/2018,35
gets an opportunity someone else gets an,12/20/2018,35
opportunity like : will end up being,12/20/2018,35
better for it,12/20/2018,35
in Detroit when you had the good defense,12/20/2018,35
when there tonight Riley talked about,12/20/2018,35
keeping his defense his defensive came,12/20/2018,35
up as well as that the case of those,12/20/2018,35
well I think it's you know all the most,12/20/2018,35
important thing in the end you're gonna,12/20/2018,35
have to play really good defense to win,12/20/2018,35
and so you have to be a heavy team that,12/20/2018,35
can play on the cycle and you're gonna,12/20/2018,35
have to be a team that can really defend,12/20/2018,35
if you want to have success and we'd,12/20/2018,35
like to become that team we got lots of,12/20/2018,35
young players here they're gonna get,12/20/2018,35
better and continue to get better and,12/20/2018,35
then we got no Maddie's looks like,12/20/2018,35
Easter mean shape now and then we'll,12/20/2018,35
ease as you can tell us is a ways away,12/20/2018,35
but as we get her group going we think,12/20/2018,35
we become a real good team well you,12/20/2018,35
think obviously we got we're deep down,12/20/2018,35
the middle I thought the goat did a good,12/20/2018,35
job today too we had four good lines and,12/20/2018,35
you want to be deep down the middle to,12/20/2018,35
me that's a key part of I want to be,12/20/2018,35
deep in the back and real good and goal,12/20/2018,35
and that gives you a chance to have,12/20/2018,35
success oh it's good player he's you,12/20/2018,35
know camera you know we've talked about,12/20/2018,35
before he thinks he's a moose jug and,12/20/2018,35
now you know he is,12/20/2018,35
so turf he's good it's having fun take,12/20/2018,35
care guys,12/20/2018,35
so Ennis broke his ankle so he's out for,12/22/2018,36
a while we'll figure out what we're,12/22/2018,36
doing tonight and then move only got 11,12/22/2018,36
forward so I'll do something there,12/22/2018,36
hi guys who are you good what's your,12/22/2018,36
name,12/22/2018,36
a hockey fan Jack hold you buddy,12/22/2018,36
you play hockey yeah are you any good,12/22/2018,36
yeah what position might be able to use,12/22/2018,36
your men well and he was coming on right,12/22/2018,36
you know was your didn't go as good as,12/22/2018,36
you wanted last year and he was starting,12/22/2018,36
to come so it's unfortunate it's because,12/22/2018,36
we all know it's all part of hockey yeah,12/22/2018,36
and you gotta have a lot of depth of,12/22/2018,36
success so you know we'll take a look at,12/22/2018,36
what's going on there talk to Sheldon,12/22/2018,36
and do Bo call someone up,12/22/2018,36
yeah I mean he's always I mean every,12/22/2018,36
night he's one of our best players if,12/22/2018,36
not our best player and works real hard,12/22/2018,36
real good defensively does it right and,12/22/2018,36
in the end if you do it right you get,12/22/2018,36
rewarded and so he's been rewarded,12/22/2018,36
well Riley's good player plays every,12/22/2018,36
night lots of enthusiasm both guys got,12/22/2018,36
tons of energy and never get tired and,12/22/2018,36
it helps you in a league that you play a,12/22/2018,36
lot well it got away at times I like,12/22/2018,36
their first beard,12/22/2018,36
yeah I mean top 6.9 I don't really know,12/23/2018,37
on our team to be honest with you over,12/23/2018,37
time we'll figure it out I don't know if,12/23/2018,37
there's much difference between them so,12/23/2018,37
but he's been good for us for sure I,12/23/2018,37
mean we were very good at the start to,12/23/2018,37
me obviously started good about four,12/23/2018,37
shifts and then didn't think it was,12/23/2018,37
gonna be hard enough and then didn't,12/23/2018,37
play hard enough but you know we have,12/23/2018,37
skill and we got determined and got it,12/23/2018,37
done,12/23/2018,37
yeah I mean I like the resiliency when,12/23/2018,37
we need it I wish we didn't have to use,12/23/2018,37
it but it's 82 games and when you look,12/23/2018,37
at it at the end the teams that win lots,12/23/2018,37
that win 3-2,12/23/2018,37
they come back they find ways to win,12/23/2018,37
that's what good teams do it's not,12/23/2018,37
perfect every night you like it to be,12/23/2018,37
but it's not and they worked really hard,12/23/2018,37
and I knew they were gonna work real,12/23/2018,37
hard we didn't work as hard in the first,12/23/2018,37
you know I don't know how long you'd say,12/23/2018,37
whatever and in the end no we found a,12/23/2018,37
way to win and so it's a good feeling,12/23/2018,37
going into Christmas the guys have done,12/23/2018,37
a good job we've set ourselves up I,12/23/2018,37
think the game 37 through 37 games now,12/23/2018,37
we gotta freshen up and get ready to go,12/23/2018,37
again,12/23/2018,37
I thought he had good I mean I heard he,12/23/2018,37
played him I thought he had good speed,12/23/2018,37
they made the good play to give us,12/23/2018,37
energy more as he made a good play you,12/23/2018,37
know par made a good play and go made a,12/23/2018,37
good shot so that gave us energy and got,12/23/2018,37
us gone we were dead till that point so,12/23/2018,37
I mean I was real positive that but I,12/23/2018,37
mean what I like about him he's a pro,12/23/2018,37
what I like about him is he's calm what,12/23/2018,37
I like about him is he doesn't none of,12/23/2018,37
this matters just gonna come and do his,12/23/2018,37
job doesn't matter he's a man and so I,12/23/2018,37
think it's given Patti Marlo and haensi,12/23/2018,37
and those guys another Ally and and and,12/23/2018,37
good leadership,12/23/2018,37
yeah I thought we weren't very good,12/23/2018,37
early so we spent a lot of time in her,12/23/2018,37
zone so he was in the group that was,12/23/2018,37
helping that happen and then as we got,12/23/2018,37
going and he settled in he got better I,12/23/2018,37
thought he was I thought he was engaged,12/23/2018,37
opening faceoff then I thought he won a,12/23/2018,37
battle to set up ended up leading till,12/23/2018,37
the goal and I thought he skated better,12/23/2018,37
than he skated the whole time wherever I,12/23/2018,37
play well I mean that's what we talked,12/23/2018,37
about earlier today I was actually,12/23/2018,37
laughing I almost said that going out,12/23/2018,37
for the period to the guys but I thought,12/23/2018,37
they wouldn't know what I was talking,12/23/2018,37
about anyway so but you know I think we,12/23/2018,37
got good players and I think all players,12/23/2018,37
can score,12/23/2018,37
well that helps them for sure you know,12/23/2018,37
in the end you want to your job as the,12/23/2018,37
goal you stout goaltend them too you,12/23/2018,37
know so you just got to keep getting,12/23/2018,37
better and you got to find your,12/23/2018,37
confidence and you know the biggest,12/23/2018,37
thing what happens when you're,12/23/2018,37
overplaying things when you're young and,12/23/2018,37
you're first starting is you end up,12/23/2018,37
swimming a little bit instead of just,12/23/2018,37
being poised and calm and he'll get more,12/23/2018,37
poised as he goes yeah I mean it's a,12/23/2018,37
city it's you can be really good in,12/23/2018,37
American League and never play here,12/23/2018,37
right and there's some guys they're,12/23/2018,37
gonna find their niche and find their,12/23/2018,37
way we have a bunch of kids down there,12/23/2018,37
now that we monitor very closely we're,12/23/2018,37
fortunate we can go all the games or,12/23/2018,37
watch them on TV so we get to see a lot,12/23/2018,37
of them you know you know what's gonna,12/23/2018,37
be hard to make our team we'll add other,12/23/2018,37
guys as well so it's gonna be a tough,12/23/2018,37
roster to make but you know we encourage,12/23/2018,37
the competition,12/23/2018,37
the first couple of goals in get rid of,12/28/2018,38
the rust factor and then obviously get,12/28/2018,38
some great shifts from all four lines to,12/28/2018,38
really drain the energy why you thought,12/28/2018,38
we started getting here tonight probably,12/28/2018,38
better than expected to tell you the,12/28/2018,38
truth and it was nice to score early,12/28/2018,38
obviously anytime you can score put you,12/28/2018,38
in a good situation and the answer,12/28/2018,38
better with one but we kept playing,12/28/2018,38
pretty good and like you said we've got,12/28/2018,38
all four lines in the board there and,12/28/2018,38
doing a good job coats on the three,12/28/2018,38
games corners free so that's positive,12/28/2018,38
for the group and we're good specially,12/28/2018,38
to well we just felt after a break it's,12/28/2018,38
important for Freddie to get some,12/28/2018,38
practice in and you know Freddy's our,12/28/2018,38
guy and we got to make sure he's healthy,12/28/2018,38
and so we just will probably do it after,12/28/2018,38
the next break as well and he's just I,12/28/2018,38
mean goats everywhere he's never gone,12/28/2018,38
all he does is win and you know he's,12/28/2018,38
he's just a big guy who plays good,12/28/2018,38
defense and stays above the puck and I,12/28/2018,38
was he's working at his game the more,12/28/2018,38
plays he can make offensively the more,12/28/2018,38
he's gonna find himself staying in the,12/28/2018,38
National Hockey League but he's done a,12/28/2018,38
real nice job for us and he's a good guy,12/28/2018,38
that guys liking the place well I mean,12/28/2018,38
he's gonna stick the crowbar is heavy,12/28/2018,38
heavy on he's got a lead hockey sense,12/28/2018,38
and so who knows I mean today he got to,12/28/2018,38
pitch me a real good play on a power,12/28/2018,38
play they'll go off now and then I tip,12/28/2018,38
and they're off John and so I once by,12/28/2018,38
the rocket of a second shot but he finds,12/28/2018,38
his way to the net and he knows where,12/28/2018,38
goals are scored I say this every time,12/28/2018,38
you guys ask me this I said the same,12/28/2018,38
thing hope is great but I don't know how,12/28/2018,38
it's gonna go so I'm gonna do whatever I,12/28/2018,38
got to do to get ourselves in a place,12/28/2018,38
that sparks made some saves tonight lots,12/28/2018,38
of the games that we played we've scored,12/28/2018,38
lots of goals for him and,12/28/2018,38
we found a way to win but hasn't been,12/28/2018,38
tonight he had to make some big saves,12/28/2018,38
especially in the second period there,12/28/2018,38
and you know it's positive for him it,12/28/2018,38
gives you confidence and it allows you,12/28/2018,38
to build on yeah I don't know how,12/28/2018,38
emotional before all of them but I mean,12/28/2018,38
for some of them for sure and then they,12/28/2018,38
got guys on that team I mean leo is a,12/28/2018,38
huge part of this team for a long time,12/28/2018,38
Matt Martin did a real good job here,12/28/2018,38
looking after our guys was a real good,12/28/2018,38
teammate and and so when you go through,12/28/2018,38
it like that I mean John Tavares for a,12/28/2018,38
lot of years Capital not team and it's,12/28/2018,38
proud of the time he put in there so the,12/28/2018,38
guys would want to play hard for John,12/28/2018,38
laughing I mean I thought Sparky was,12/29/2018,39
unbelievable actually in the first thing,12/29/2018,39
we gave up sixth grade AIDS we don't,12/29/2018,39
usually give up sixth grade aids in the,12/29/2018,39
game so we turn a puck over they,12/29/2018,39
countered,12/29/2018,39
they played exactly like we expected,12/29/2018,39
they played hard they were better than,12/29/2018,39
us we're on the outside they were on the,12/29/2018,39
inside they gave us a lesson we got four,12/29/2018,39
days off let's get regrouped let's get,12/29/2018,39
back at her let's get another run going,12/29/2018,39
[Music],12/29/2018,39
we're all in it together too and,12/29/2018,39
everyone wanted to help John win table,12/29/2018,39
we obviously didn't do a very good job,12/29/2018,39
right through from coaching staff right,12/29/2018,39
through the players and any way you look,12/29/2018,39
at it we didn't play hard enough now,12/29/2018,39
we've just I think we just want one five,12/29/2018,39
and I think we want lost one in overtime,12/29/2018,39
so that's our best run of the year we've,12/29/2018,39
had two of those runs we need to have,12/29/2018,39
another one now and get back at it so I,12/29/2018,39
would have liked to sit around tomorrow,12/29/2018,39
on an off day and enjoy what we're doing,12/29/2018,39
but this way I won't be very relaxed,12/29/2018,39
well I don't look at like that today's a,12/29/2018,39
game we were playing they traveled we,12/29/2018,39
traveled they played we played,12/29/2018,39
everything was even they were better,12/29/2018,39
than us,12/29/2018,39
so that's on us we gotta fix that the,12/29/2018,39
other thing about is the way they played,12/29/2018,39
is they made it hard for you they were,12/29/2018,39
waiting for their chances they countered,12/29/2018,39
and we knew it and that's how it gets as,12/29/2018,39
the Year gets tougher it gets like that,12/29/2018,39
and so there's no three-on-two there's,12/29/2018,39
no two-on-ones you got to dig in and,12/29/2018,39
play in the tight areas and we didn't do,12/29/2018,39
that,12/29/2018,39
okay no I mean it's like I said we just,12/29/2018,39
had a good run we obviously dropped the,12/29/2018,39
ball here and I weren't good enough and,12/29/2018,39
is it disappointing yes is it puzzling,12/29/2018,39
no well Elite edges obviously good,12/29/2018,39
hockey sense good kid wants to be a good,12/29/2018,39
player it's gotten a lot stronger over,12/29/2018,39
your but a real good player and he had a,12/29/2018,39
good night against us tonight yes well,12/29/2018,39
we were trying to do that for a long,12/29/2018,39
time it just kind of happened off here,12/29/2018,39
but I mean obviously when we lost the,12/29/2018,39
two guys we knew right away you're,12/29/2018,39
hoping you weren't losing two guys right,12/29/2018,39
you thought you might lose one you,12/29/2018,39
didn't know you're gonna lose two and so,12/29/2018,39
it's been an issue for us and so you,12/29/2018,39
know this gives us a real good,12/29/2018,39
opportunity to give Cal some help you,12/29/2018,39
know with the Marty's which I think it's,12/29/2018,39
important last year pic did a real good,12/29/2018,39
job with Sparky helping him out and the,12/29/2018,39
same thing can happen this opportunity,12/29/2018,39
what it's not what who did this but I,12/29/2018,39
mean that can play into what we still,12/29/2018,39
expect Freddie to be we don't think this,12/29/2018,39
is long term they played last night and,12/29/2018,39
didn't come the rink today otherwise you,12/29/2018,39
would for sure I mean Leo mat was great,12/29/2018,39
teammate looked after us Leo was,12/29/2018,39
unbelievable leaf in my opinion and a,12/29/2018,39
real team guy real important for us did,12/29/2018,39
a real good job that's the way the,12/29/2018,39
business is though there's always lots,12/29/2018,39
of good people that are leaving it's,12/29/2018,39
unfortunate and freezing time not just,12/29/2018,39
ways,12/29/2018,39
my third a heavy team to play against,1/3/2019,40
but with a power place and all that when,1/3/2019,40
did you think you act enough to get the,1/3/2019,40
job done here today well I thought their,1/3/2019,40
goaltender was good I thought we scored,1/3/2019,40
twice in the first period I didn't like,1/3/2019,40
our first period I thought they I,1/3/2019,40
thought they were better than us I,1/3/2019,40
thought after that I liked her game a,1/3/2019,40
lot sort of great game for our team it's,1/3/2019,40
the kind of game you got to learn how to,1/3/2019,40
win all kinds of games and they got good,1/3/2019,40
faceoff guys there are a veteran team,1/3/2019,40
they make it hard on you physically yeah,1/3/2019,40
cuz they're physical on offense they're,1/3/2019,40
near your net they're making it hard for,1/3/2019,40
you to handle them we had 17 DS on face,1/3/2019,40
offs in the first period and so they,1/3/2019,40
were on us and even when we won we,1/3/2019,40
didn't execute but I thought after that,1/3/2019,40
I thought you know we left that period,1/3/2019,40
to one or whatever I thought I thought,1/3/2019,40
we played a pretty good game I'd like to,1/3/2019,40
see us score I don't know how many power,1/3/2019,40
plays we had but we stayed in their zone,1/3/2019,40
the whole time had real opportunities,1/3/2019,40
and but it didn't go our way but I,1/3/2019,40
really like the opportunity for our team,1/3/2019,40
we got to learn how to win these games,1/3/2019,40
you got to win all types of games well I,1/3/2019,40
thought he was already give us a chance,1/3/2019,40
that's all he can ask for the guy what,1/3/2019,40
was the sequence of events they called,1/3/2019,40
me told me this part could go so we knew,1/3/2019,40
he was gonna play,1/3/2019,40
I asked what his first name was they,1/3/2019,40
told me Austin where I like to be called,1/3/2019,40
said Hutchins said have fun how's that,1/3/2019,40
yeah he was out again today so I mean,1/3/2019,40
everything's moving along according to,1/3/2019,40
our medical people that way but you know,1/3/2019,40
what is what it is he's ready when he's,1/3/2019,40
ready but I didn't think tonight for us,1/3/2019,40
that you could I thought I just gave us,1/3/2019,40
an opportunity that's all you can ask of,1/3/2019,40
him and then we got to do our part I,1/3/2019,40
don't have any expectation so I don't,1/3/2019,40
know what's going on we're just talking,1/3/2019,40
about and maybe finding another goalie,1/3/2019,40
we like casts to get playing we want,1/3/2019,40
them to be sitting around so maybe we,1/3/2019,40
got to find,1/3/2019,40
goli and then well you know why killing,1/3/2019,40
it what its gonna do is get them to,1/3/2019,40
compete harder skate harder and take a,1/3/2019,40
load off them and get going and you know,1/3/2019,40
I thought he's gonna get the winner here,1/3/2019,40
tonight I thought one wasn't gonna be,1/3/2019,40
enough in the end it was that's all he,1/3/2019,40
got but you know we need him to help our,1/3/2019,40
team and be a productive leaf and we,1/3/2019,40
think he can be we think it's just a,1/3/2019,40
matter of time,1/3/2019,40
like what impressed you about the,1/5/2019,41
thoroughness of tonight's victory well I,1/5/2019,41
just thought I thought we played pretty,1/5/2019,41
well I thought we worked we tracked we,1/5/2019,41
played hard in the ozone,1/5/2019,41
you know we had most guys go on and and,1/5/2019,41
so I thought that was really positive,1/5/2019,41
but you know when we put her work in,1/5/2019,41
front of her skill we got a chance to,1/5/2019,41
have success yeah I said it was good I,1/5/2019,41
didn't think they had a ton but he,1/5/2019,41
didn't make any of their chances in the,1/5/2019,41
two or three chances he just played,1/5/2019,41
solid and was steady and you know I,1/5/2019,41
think they had three power plays if I'm,1/5/2019,41
not mistaken and so he obviously had,1/5/2019,41
some action at that time and did a good,1/5/2019,41
job well he's gonna be a known each,1/5/2019,41
other for sure it's just - how soon do,1/5/2019,41
you want them to play minutes you know,1/5/2019,41
what I mean so that's the beauty about,1/5/2019,41
not getting kids here too soon is they,1/5/2019,41
you want them to score the more he,1/5/2019,41
scores the more likely he's gonna score,1/5/2019,41
at the NHL level that means any child,1/5/2019,41
player but you know I mean how many,1/5/2019,41
years who want to do that so you know,1/5/2019,41
that's the big thing for us obviously,1/5/2019,41
when we get healthy he can go down and,1/5/2019,41
he can score a lot and become a scorer,1/5/2019,41
rather than a checker well I think,1/5/2019,41
they're pushing to get a win for,1/5/2019,41
themselves right I think that's how they,1/5/2019,41
started and then then obviously when I,1/5/2019,41
looked like it was going pretty good you,1/5/2019,41
you obviously want to help but row,1/5/2019,41
you know he's come in and helped us out,1/5/2019,41
here and given us an opportunity and,1/5/2019,41
that's good it sounds like we're gonna,1/5/2019,41
have lots of goalies tomorrow on the ice,1/5/2019,41
for practice so that's a good thing what,1/5/2019,41
does it tell you about your team that,1/5/2019,41
Freddie and,1/5/2019,41
well that's what they should be doing,1/5/2019,41
right that's what good teammates do,1/5/2019,41
did you see the opening 40 minutes,1/7/2019,42
tonight thank you like that may have,1/7/2019,42
changed the way this game could have,1/7/2019,42
ended why didn't mind us through to in,1/7/2019,42
saying that you know they were up to,1/7/2019,42
nothing and they had blocked lots of,1/7/2019,42
shots and kept the puck from the net and,1/7/2019,42
we'd find a way to get out of the lane I,1/7/2019,42
thought we got a lesson from a veteran,1/7/2019,42
team here today I thought really in the,1/7/2019,42
third period in particular I didn't know,1/7/2019,42
if we thought we're just gonna come out,1/7/2019,42
and race around they just stayed patient,1/7/2019,42
and did right I thought they were heavy,1/7/2019,42
on the puck having on their sticks,1/7/2019,42
detailed block shots competed I'd like,1/7/2019,42
their game,1/7/2019,42
I liked her game through to and I,1/7/2019,42
thought we were in a good spot to crawl,1/7/2019,42
our way back thought if we worked hard,1/7/2019,42
we get a power play I liked her ii,1/7/2019,42
didn't get the puck to learn that enough,1/7/2019,42
had opportunity to and didn't and then,1/7/2019,42
in the third period it was just men and,1/7/2019,42
boys and you got to understand you got,1/7/2019,42
to be patient you can't just race around,1/7/2019,42
you got to play the game right and if,1/7/2019,42
you you do to reward it but you know I,1/7/2019,42
like 13 tonight their faceoff circle I,1/7/2019,42
think we were three and 15 in the first,1/7/2019,42
period I thought they were dialed in I,1/7/2019,42
thought their players were playing a,1/7/2019,42
real game and it was a competitive game,1/7/2019,42
and we didn't hold our end up through 60,1/7/2019,42
wasn't good enough you know we didn't I,1/7/2019,42
mean Maddie had the wide open net so if,1/7/2019,42
you get one everyone thinks it's great,1/7/2019,42
he didn't shoot it in the empty net but,1/7/2019,42
I just still didn't think both our plan,1/7/2019,42
and our execution wasn't good enough I,1/7/2019,42
thought we got in he's heard in the,1/7/2019,42
thought I thought the faceoff circle,1/7/2019,42
could have helped us but we weren't,1/7/2019,42
dangerous enough through the two minutes,1/7/2019,42
of the power play,1/7/2019,42
no I don't think I thought last game we,1/7/2019,42
had good opportunity on it,1/7/2019,42
I think it's been hit and miss and,1/7/2019,42
hasn't been good enough and with the,1/7/2019,42
players we have it can be better so we,1/7/2019,42
got to do a better job I thought that,1/7/2019,42
line in the first two periods I thought,1/7/2019,42
was was was not bad he's got to get,1/7/2019,42
better and all the details all compete,1/7/2019,42
all well that stuff just got to keep,1/7/2019,42
getting better and he will the more he,1/7/2019,42
plays but the urgency level has to be,1/7/2019,42
there for sure,1/7/2019,42
why just the I mean we just flip Brown,1/7/2019,42
on him yeah and you know we meet some,1/7/2019,42
changes than the third cuz obviously,1/7/2019,42
we're not getting anything done but,1/7/2019,42
we'll just continue to look at it and,1/7/2019,42
see who fits best with who I think Hyman,1/7/2019,42
I'm pretty sure hymens cleared for next,1/7/2019,42
game so that will affect where everyone,1/7/2019,42
plays,1/7/2019,42
Mike your clubs 21 and oh and leading,1/10/2019,43
after 2 period to play what impressed,1/10/2019,43
you about the way they were able to,1/10/2019,43
secure the win on the road here tonight,1/10/2019,43
well I really liked her first and I,1/10/2019,43
really liked our third obviously in the,1/10/2019,43
second period we didn't take care of the,1/10/2019,43
puck and and play right but the third,1/10/2019,43
one I thought we came out and played,1/10/2019,43
really well played in the offensive zone,1/10/2019,43
took care of the puck gave up very,1/10/2019,43
little and got a good one well there,1/10/2019,43
were +4 they got you know he's involved,1/10/2019,43
in three east-west goals they're heavy,1/10/2019,43
down low as close to show you need,1/10/2019,43
people to win the puck back and he was,1/10/2019,43
able to do that for us,1/10/2019,43
no one's good for Tavares obviously 301,1/10/2019,43
goals a lot of goals in the National,1/10/2019,43
League that line was good for us tonight,1/10/2019,43
well I liked in the third period we,1/10/2019,43
didn't back up and play in our own zone,1/10/2019,43
and we played the game in the offensive,1/10/2019,43
zone when he still had to but we,1/10/2019,43
took care of it we didn't give up much I,1/10/2019,43
thought the first period was like that -,1/10/2019,43
just a second period we got away from,1/10/2019,43
team road wins the season tied for the,1/10/2019,43
league best is is that a mentality that,1/10/2019,43
has been developed over the course of,1/10/2019,43
the first few months eating yeah I don't,1/10/2019,43
know the answer left I mean we think we,1/10/2019,43
got a good team and we don't think much,1/10/2019,43
matters at home on the world you know,1/10/2019,43
we've had real good runs in both spots,1/10/2019,43
you know time was a good win for us,1/10/2019,43
that's all joy okay just your point,1/10/2019,43
participation in terms of those guys,1/10/2019,43
getting involved offensively and getting,1/10/2019,43
shots through I did did you like what,1/10/2019,43
you see I sorry I really liked I liked,1/10/2019,43
her heavy play I like to her play below,1/10/2019,43
the goal line and B were allowed to,1/10/2019,43
shoot the puck you know to me that was a,1/10/2019,43
good night for us you know got a real,1/10/2019,43
good game coming up in these real good,1/10/2019,43
teams should be fun,1/10/2019,43
like you talked about protecting the,1/12/2019,44
puck this morning was a case of maybe,1/12/2019,44
one extra mistake here tonight to,1/12/2019,44
separate the two clubs well we you know,1/12/2019,44
obviously we made a couple of mistakes,1/12/2019,44
in diesel I liked her game to be honest,1/12/2019,44
with you I thought we had good,1/12/2019,44
opportunity I thought Rask was really,1/12/2019,44
good in particularly in the second,1/12/2019,44
period where we had three unbelievable,1/12/2019,44
gradient chances and he held his ground,1/12/2019,44
and in the end that's the difference in,1/12/2019,44
the game I thought we had a couple,1/12/2019,44
mistakes there where we ended up with,1/12/2019,44
guys below the goal line for no reason,1/12/2019,44
one right at the end of the period which,1/12/2019,44
ended up costing us obviously and then,1/12/2019,44
another execution one so you have to,1/12/2019,44
clean that up but I liked I liked our,1/12/2019,44
energy I liked her matchup so like you,1/12/2019,44
know most things about it to be honest,1/12/2019,44
with you we didn't go over one certain,1/12/2019,44
Cadbury's line just because I wanted,1/12/2019,44
that matchup I thought it was a good,1/12/2019,44
matchup for us I thought to barest,1/12/2019,44
aligner,1/12/2019,44
against their birth grounds line was a,1/12/2019,44
real good matchup for us already played,1/12/2019,44
real well and did a good job and and I,1/12/2019,44
thought other guys carried lots of place,1/12/2019,44
so we had good opportunity in the game,1/12/2019,44
and we didn't win but I liked how we,1/12/2019,44
went about it,1/12/2019,44
[Music],1/12/2019,44
just crying it out I mean we headed on,1/12/2019,44
Mattie stick there rolled off them we,1/12/2019,44
don't want free I mean I'll take that,1/12/2019,44
all day long so you know you got to push,1/12/2019,44
through the everything is a little,1/12/2019,44
struggle in your life never hurt anybody,1/12/2019,44
just digging why that he made a real,1/12/2019,44
nice play on the one like I thought both,1/12/2019,44
units were good on the powerplay I,1/12/2019,44
thought we had some good looks there you,1/12/2019,44
know what was good we got a score well I,1/12/2019,44
didn't think we played as well as we,1/12/2019,44
could,1/12/2019,44
in Boston I thought we got impatient,1/12/2019,44
that some turnovers in the second period,1/12/2019,44
in there in the second game and then the,1/12/2019,44
game got away from us we took three,1/12/2019,44
penalties and roll that last one in,1/12/2019,44
there and I got that got away from us,1/12/2019,44
other than that right I don't mind your,1/12/2019,44
team against them,1/12/2019,44
you know it's you're gonna play real,1/12/2019,44
good teams if you're fortunate enough to,1/12/2019,44
be in the playoffs and they're probably,1/12/2019,44
one of,1/12/2019,44
what was the difference Mike you get the,1/14/2019,45
start you wanted what happened beyond,1/14/2019,45
that that tells it in their favor,1/14/2019,45
inevitably I why I thought they worked,1/14/2019,45
harder than we did and any way you look,1/14/2019,45
at it I think we're like Inc were 500 in,1/14/2019,45
our last 10 since Christmas we haven't,1/14/2019,45
been engaged enough and haven't competed,1/14/2019,45
at a high enough level and if you just,1/14/2019,45
did a who won the races and who won all,1/14/2019,45
the bottles is they did the game was,1/14/2019,45
fair in the end yeah you know we I,1/14/2019,45
thought we're in a good spot obviously,1/14/2019,45
we had good chances in the first on the,1/14/2019,45
power play we had the breakaway with the,1/14/2019,45
same scene pass in st. all that they,1/14/2019,45
kept winning more and more as the game,1/14/2019,45
went on they deserve the one there's no,1/14/2019,45
question about that,1/14/2019,45
you could say that about the fourth goal,1/14/2019,45
#NAME?,1/14/2019,45
that this week so that means not,1/14/2019,45
mentally sharp but not physically,1/14/2019,45
engaged enough either and so we only got,1/14/2019,45
ourselves to blame so obviously myself,1/14/2019,45
as the head coach I'm responsible we,1/14/2019,45
didn't play well enough didn't play hard,1/14/2019,45
enough and the players the same way we,1/14/2019,45
weren't good enough we'll take a day off,1/14/2019,45
tomorrow and take a breath and we'll get,1/14/2019,45
back to work because this is not good,1/14/2019,45
enough,1/14/2019,45
well for sure no question about that you,1/14/2019,45
know when and tonight we got Freddie,1/14/2019,45
back that should give us a boost but in,1/14/2019,45
the end we didn't manage it like it was,1/14/2019,45
a boost and so it cost us but we haven't,1/14/2019,45
been good enough so you get what you get,1/14/2019,45
and the league's gone by and there,1/14/2019,45
everyone's getting better and and we've,1/14/2019,45
hit a lull and so we got to get turned I,1/14/2019,45
would say is that he's a really really,1/14/2019,45
good player a really important piece and,1/14/2019,45
play good yeah and so the good thing,1/14/2019,45
about our fans they're passionate they,1/14/2019,45
want us to win they wants to play way,1/14/2019,45
harder than that and we want to play,1/14/2019,45
harder than that for them and I think,1/14/2019,45
we've done a good job over time here to,1/14/2019,45
be a real good team to watch we weren't,1/14/2019,45
good enough to watch and they paid their,1/14/2019,45
money they're allowed to say what they,1/14/2019,45
want but the bottom line he's an,1/14/2019,45
important player for us we need a movie,1/14/2019,45
that we haven't been very good so oh yes,1/14/2019,45
I mean we can compete way harder than we,1/14/2019,45
are right now for whatever reason since,1/14/2019,45
it's Christmas we haven't found that,1/14/2019,45
level I don't know why that is we have,1/14/2019,45
in games I thought a lot of the Boston,1/14/2019,45
need a lot of Nashville game I mean the,1/14/2019,45
Vancouver but it hasn't been every day,1/14/2019,45
and at a high enough level and you're,1/14/2019,45
not gonna win the NHL's to tight,1/14/2019,45
from Fred the Qadri line and right on,1/17/2019,46
through I would just sum it all up here,1/17/2019,46
tonight and a big win against a very,1/17/2019,46
good team yeah I thought we you know I,1/17/2019,46
thought we had a good effort I know we,1/17/2019,46
had everybody on board fred was real,1/17/2019,46
good in the third obviously down the,1/17/2019,46
stretch but I thought our team played,1/17/2019,46
well we could have had a lot more I,1/17/2019,46
thought their goaltender was good too,1/17/2019,46
but it was a good game for our team we,1/17/2019,46
haven't been as sharp as you know here,1/17/2019,46
lately and so I thought this was a good,1/17/2019,46
response we talked a lot about it and,1/17/2019,46
getting back on track working hard and,1/17/2019,46
doing things right I thought we did that,1/17/2019,46
tonight raising the level of compete,1/17/2019,46
would you agree with that yeah for sure,1/17/2019,46
it was a very competitive game yeah you,1/17/2019,46
know there wasn't a whole lot of room,1/17/2019,46
for either team especially through two,1/17/2019,46
periods and I thought our guys really,1/17/2019,46
dug in there and worked hard and,1/17/2019,46
competing hard yeah it's great question,1/17/2019,46
you know you know Patti it hadn't been,1/17/2019,46
on the board in a while now as obviously,1/17/2019,46
I know wasn't as good the other night,1/17/2019,46
and then you know was it just capping,1/17/2019,46
him being with him I don't know but they,1/17/2019,46
had a good night for us and set the tone,1/17/2019,46
and got us going,1/17/2019,46
yeah I thought you know the first one,1/17/2019,46
it's a bounce comes right to them we,1/17/2019,46
were you know you're hoping to get hit,1/17/2019,46
didn't happen they had probably some,1/17/2019,46
better looks later and it didn't go in,1/17/2019,46
but you know they're a good team you,1/17/2019,46
don't want to be in the box at all you,1/17/2019,46
want to play with discipline but you,1/17/2019,46
know it was good killing by our guys and,1/17/2019,46
obviously Freddie was good well,1/17/2019,46
obviously you know I say it all the time,1/17/2019,46
you always want your low spells to be as,1/17/2019,46
short as you can this one here to me you,1/17/2019,46
know got long no we didn't have Freddy,1/17/2019,46
for a while and all that but I still,1/17/2019,46
didn't think we dug in like we could and,1/17/2019,46
it was great to see and you know we,1/17/2019,46
gotta get back to work you got to work,1/17/2019,46
at a high level if you want if you got,1/17/2019,46
skill and you don't work and you don't,1/17/2019,46
win anyway so we got to compete at I,1/17/2019,46
love,1/17/2019,46
that tonight I thought he was really,1/17/2019,46
good you know why I think this last,1/17/2019,46
little while he's been getting better,1/17/2019,46
and better and you know anytime you got,1/17/2019,46
off to a great start this year he got,1/17/2019,46
injured and then you always have a that,1/17/2019,46
initial real bump and then reality sets,1/17/2019,46
in and then but I think he's really,1/17/2019,46
digging in no and I thought he was,1/17/2019,46
really good without the puck when he,1/17/2019,46
uses his body well it's just such a big,1/17/2019,46
man you know and he can protect the puck,1/17/2019,46
physical on offense he's never really,1/17/2019,46
gonna be left physical on defense just,1/17/2019,46
physical and off and some protecting the,1/17/2019,46
puck hanging on to it having a lot and I,1/17/2019,46
thought that line was effective,1/17/2019,46
difficult getting to the opposition net,1/18/2019,47
here for the better part of this game,1/18/2019,47
Mike yeah I thought it was tightly,1/18/2019,47
contested game I thought they were,1/18/2019,47
better than us at the start appear like,1/18/2019,47
it took us a while to get our legs going,1/18/2019,47
we got ourselves behind to one and then,1/18/2019,47
I thought they did a real nice job and,1/18/2019,47
and we didn't execute it a high enough,1/18/2019,47
level to make it hard on the long go at,1/18/2019,47
all tonight so give them credit they had,1/18/2019,47
good energy they played real well and,1/18/2019,47
and we were unable to follow up last,1/18/2019,47
night's effort with the one of the same,1/18/2019,47
Willi and Austin both expressed their,1/18/2019,47
frustration that their lack of scoring,1/18/2019,47
well I think the whole key is just work,1/18/2019,47
you know you talk about scoring they've,1/18/2019,47
had lots of different line mates and,1/18/2019,47
lots of different opportunity just go to,1/18/2019,47
work and you make simple plays and you,1/18/2019,47
played good without the puck when it's,1/18/2019,47
not going in and you work hard and next,1/18/2019,47
thing you know you find one and you get,1/18/2019,47
some momentum for yourself so the one,1/18/2019,47
thing about the league no one feels,1/18/2019,47
sorry for you,1/18/2019,47
and but we need those players to be good,1/18/2019,47
players and so that's the challenge for,1/18/2019,47
you and that's what's so tough about the,1/18/2019,47
league is it's not only a physical,1/18/2019,47
battle it's a mental battle and when,1/18/2019,47
things are going great that's great when,1/18/2019,47
they're not going good you got to dig in,1/18/2019,47
and go to work,1/18/2019,47
well I mean you know I don't know kept,1/18/2019,47
he started the year on the fourth line,1/18/2019,47
but she just played there rose I think,1/18/2019,47
his first year just when I was learning,1/18/2019,47
to play a little bit but the bottom line,1/18/2019,47
is we don't want really on the fourth,1/18/2019,47
line we want Willie being a contributor,1/18/2019,47
for our Aki Club he's an honest kid and,1/18/2019,47
usually puts in a good effort so he'll,1/18/2019,47
continue to work at it and but you know,1/18/2019,47
he's never been through anything,1/18/2019,47
probably like this before is it's tough,1/18/2019,47
catching up as you can see right the,1/18/2019,47
line change Kim was trying to win the,1/18/2019,47
hockey game I mean I changed my lines in,1/18/2019,47
the first I changed them in the second,1/18/2019,47
you're just trying to get something,1/18/2019,47
going because we weren't going you know,1/18/2019,47
I never know I don't think that I think,1/18/2019,47
you'll go there was always highs and,1/18/2019,47
lows I don't see that at all I think,1/18/2019,47
we've been a pretty good team and we,1/18/2019,47
just got to keep getting better but the,1/18/2019,47
thing about the National Hockey League,1/18/2019,47
is it's very very tight if you don't,1/18/2019,47
have your a-game and they jump on you're,1/18/2019,47
not gonna win that's it's just that,1/18/2019,47
simple that not with TRO chicken beaks,1/18/2019,47
they're back they got it they got a good,1/18/2019,47
team here and so we knew it was gonna be,1/18/2019,47
hard coming in and we would have liked,1/18/2019,47
to been better no no I I have I've said,1/18/2019,47
a number of times that I didn't think,1/18/2019,47
we're as good after Christmas in saying,1/18/2019,47
that we played some real good games and,1/18/2019,47
and didn't win I think Freddie getting,1/18/2019,47
injured and not being available for a,1/18/2019,47
period of time didn't help us either but,1/18/2019,47
you know I think we can get going better,1/18/2019,47
for sure but I also think it's an,1/18/2019,47
82-game schedule and steady on the,1/18/2019,47
rudder let's keep getting better,1/18/2019,47
my fighters we spoke to John Austin,1/20/2019,48
Travis Lee they all thought it's a,1/20/2019,48
matter of state of course in working,1/20/2019,48
through this you see it that way and,1/20/2019,48
just went how tough things have been,1/20/2019,48
offensive way yeah totally but I also,1/20/2019,48
thought tonight I thought we played hard,1/20/2019,48
I know we had the puck a lot I didn't,1/20/2019,48
think we had a lot of puck luck to be,1/20/2019,48
honest with you we had lots of attempts,1/20/2019,48
the pucks lying there we never got it to,1/20/2019,48
the net as much as we could have off,1/20/2019,48
those kind of rebounds and pucks laying,1/20/2019,48
there but like a lot of things we did it,1/20/2019,48
appeared to me I haven't watched the,1/20/2019,48
game but it appeared to me live that we,1/20/2019,48
had the puck an absolute ton and in the,1/20/2019,48
end we didn't win the game and you're,1/20/2019,48
gonna have some of those the biggest,1/20/2019,48
thing is is when you're I like their,1/20/2019,48
game in Tampa didn't think we had enough,1/20/2019,48
energy in East Florida,1/20/2019,48
I like their energy here today just keep,1/20/2019,48
trying we'll work our way out,1/20/2019,48
I know we had pretty good urgency,1/20/2019,48
tonight I mean like I said to you we had,1/20/2019,48
the pocket on the the puck didn't go in,1/20/2019,48
for us,1/20/2019,48
I thought they blocked the ton of shots,1/20/2019,48
I thought they did lots of good things,1/20/2019,48
stayed inside in saying that you can,1/20/2019,48
always be a little you can always want,1/20/2019,48
more but I thought we stayed the course,1/20/2019,48
I didn't think we gave up that much I,1/20/2019,48
thought we did pretty job I mean I would,1/20/2019,48
like that Jake because we had a lot more,1/20/2019,48
place you know in the more plays you can,1/20/2019,48
have for the back the more chance you,1/20/2019,48
have for clean looks offensively but you,1/20/2019,48
know we I don't know if it's been a week,1/20/2019,48
or ten days or whatever he's had these,1/20/2019,48
back spasms and he's been all the play,1/20/2019,48
through it and but when he got on a,1/20/2019,48
plane I don't know two nights ago I,1/20/2019,48
guess it was or whatever he could,1/20/2019,48
already move and we were hopeful that he,1/20/2019,48
tried this morning but couldn't do it,1/20/2019,48
yeah they just told me that he's not,1/20/2019,48
gonna be available for next game and so,1/20/2019,48
I don't know exactly what it is but not,1/20/2019,48
gonna be available for next game so,1/20/2019,48
we'll have to get more in here I thought,1/20/2019,48
the fourth line you know there's two,1/20/2019,48
games enrolled and he's been at the net,1/20/2019,48
when we scored I thought they were good,1/20/2019,48
they were good on the penalty kill when,1/20/2019,48
they were used that way you know,1/20/2019,48
obviously we didn't have we only had 11,1/20/2019,48
forwards in the third period but I,1/20/2019,48
thought their respective,1/20/2019,48
yeah but I thought I thought his game in,1/20/2019,48
Tampa and I thought his game today were,1/20/2019,48
good you know I thought he skated and he,1/20/2019,48
moved and to me the rest of it when you,1/20/2019,48
do good things good things happen and,1/20/2019,48
sometimes in the meantime when it's not,1/20/2019,48
going your way you can get your own way,1/20/2019,48
don't just work they don't know the,1/20/2019,48
answer that question obviously he's not,1/20/2019,48
gonna we're gonna practice tomorrow,1/20/2019,48
he's not gonna practice the moral and,1/20/2019,48
then we have another practice day prior,1/20/2019,48
to final Washington so we'll know more,1/20/2019,48
at that time,1/20/2019,48
would you think if your clubs work-ethic,1/23/2019,49
able to score goals after Washington,1/23/2019,49
open both the first and second what,1/23/2019,49
goals yeah you know I'm just a good I,1/23/2019,49
mean I really liked our first penalty,1/23/2019,49
killing their thing ends up in her net,1/23/2019,49
you know was I thought her guys have,1/23/2019,49
done a great job but that's unfortunate,1/23/2019,49
but you know we had a good effort,1/23/2019,49
tonight and good for guys to be rewarded,1/23/2019,49
I thought brownie Willian now is that a,1/23/2019,49
real good night for them and and it's,1/23/2019,49
good for all of them to feel good,1/23/2019,49
important for Willie but I think,1/23/2019,49
important for brownian knows as well so,1/23/2019,49
they were a real important line for us,1/23/2019,49
and I thought 2 vs. lion matched up with,1/23/2019,49
captain I'm a real good job against the,1/23/2019,49
19 line there was oviya on it and,1/23/2019,49
obviously they're a handful so that was,1/23/2019,49
important as well so you know but we had,1/23/2019,49
lots of guys on deck tonight and phone,1/23/2019,49
away to win,1/23/2019,49
what do you like about a baby well just,1/23/2019,49
being competitive winning battles and,1/23/2019,49
you know one one goal before they squirt,1/23/2019,49
he tracked all the way back and they got,1/23/2019,49
another one he won a battle just inside,1/23/2019,49
the blue line and defensive circle the,1/23/2019,49
reason you play in the older one is you,1/23/2019,49
win some battles all over the ice so you,1/23/2019,49
can play and they was on that line was,1/23/2019,49
really good,1/23/2019,49
so who's that okay yeah you know,1/23/2019,49
whatever you want to call it,1/23/2019,49
yeah they're they're fine I mean you,1/23/2019,49
know what was good for Mattie get one,1/23/2019,49
and going on the powerplay and I thought,1/23/2019,49
the power play was really good to us,1/23/2019,49
want a bunch of battles to get the puck,1/23/2019,49
back there so I thought that was good,1/23/2019,49
yeah but I you know I thought we had,1/23/2019,49
lots of good players tonight I don't I,1/23/2019,49
don't know I haven't watched the game I,1/23/2019,49
haven't go through it and see what,1/23/2019,49
happens I like them to have fun I liked,1/23/2019,49
him not to think about hockey I liked,1/23/2019,49
him to work out enough so that when they,1/23/2019,49
arrived back there ready to go,1/23/2019,49
Mike what do you take from tonight's,2/1/2019,50
result - you know predictably what,2/1/2019,50
Jeff's teams usually do and at least you,2/1/2019,50
come away with a point do you build off,2/1/2019,50
that in any way well I just think we've,2/1/2019,50
been in overtime with him last three,2/1/2019,50
times kind of what you expected I,2/1/2019,50
thought they were better than us in the,2/1/2019,50
first I thought we had a better second,2/1/2019,50
and actually thought we were doing,2/1/2019,50
pretty good in the third our last shift,2/1/2019,50
or two in the third after we tied it,2/1/2019,50
wasn't very good and then I didn't like,2/1/2019,50
our overtime that much but you know I,2/1/2019,50
don't know I mean you guys are farther,2/1/2019,50
away you saw it but I didn't know how,2/1/2019,50
smoothly executed the game was look like,2/1/2019,50
team said about a week off well I mean,2/1/2019,50
you know the bottom line and they got,2/1/2019,50
one we had one to face up didn't clear,2/1/2019,50
and our power play wasn't able to,2/1/2019,50
capitalize so in the end that's you know,2/1/2019,50
that's gaming out of when the special,2/1/2019,50
teams battle but I didn't think our,2/1/2019,50
power play well give them credit that's,2/1/2019,50
our penalty kill was real good I didn't,2/1/2019,50
think our power play was very dangerous,2/1/2019,50
tonight we changed it in the game - and,2/1/2019,50
maybe we shouldn't have maybe we should,2/1/2019,50
have practiced it before we went to it,2/1/2019,50
but in the end I wouldn't score no I,2/1/2019,50
don't see that I thought it's last a,2/1/2019,50
little bit I thought we've been really,2/1/2019,50
coming to the truth I don't think you,2/1/2019,50
can say whatever you want I don't think,2/1/2019,50
that at all actually I thought our guys,2/1/2019,50
worked tried I mean any time you've had,2/1/2019,50
as much time office is both teams you're,2/1/2019,50
not gonna be quite as smooth we just got,2/1/2019,50
to keep well it's pretty but I thought,2/1/2019,50
that I thought they did a good job,2/1/2019,50
tonight too though and we knew going in,2/1/2019,50
but you're right we didn't execute in,2/1/2019,50
that area as good as we could we didn't,2/1/2019,50
and then the third period when we had,2/1/2019,50
our opportunities we flat out just,2/1/2019,50
didn't do a good job on it so that's,2/1/2019,50
over with we'll regroup and get ready,2/1/2019,50
for Pittsburgh tomorrow yeah I mean I,2/1/2019,50
have no chance to go through the game I,2/1/2019,50
uh I thought the puck was on the wall a,2/1/2019,50
lot for our team or the forecheck was,2/1/2019,50
good for them we didn't make a lot of,2/1/2019,50
plays I thought as the game went on we,2/1/2019,50
made more plays and send that you know,2/1/2019,50
we'll look at the game here tonight on,2/1/2019,50
the flight home and we'll get ready for,2/1/2019,50
them all,2/1/2019,50
you think it's a Matthews line obviously,2/1/2019,50
chipped into goals their second game,2/1/2019,50
together yeah I thought I thought that,2/1/2019,50
group was better you know I'm gonna move,2/1/2019,50
things around tomorrow just for a,2/1/2019,50
matchup against Pittsburgh we'll see,2/1/2019,50
what happens,2/1/2019,50
hello Patrick Marlowe's impact on a,2/2/2019,51
night like tonight even last night and,2/2/2019,51
when things are so tough and just how,2/2/2019,51
whether the Mitch Marner blocking shots,2/2/2019,51
and just the role model has been what he,2/2/2019,51
really skated good sense he'd come back,2/2/2019,51
from the break I didn't think many of us,2/2/2019,51
skate great last night I thought he was,2/2/2019,51
one of the guys that really did I,2/2/2019,51
thought he's scared of real well tonight,2/2/2019,51
and it was real too good in the faceoff,2/2/2019,51
circle tonight took a lot of for he,2/2/2019,51
sauce for Matthews well that was real,2/2/2019,51
positive and obviously he's a real,2/2/2019,51
leader I mean it's well documented on,2/2/2019,51
her team and good man well and obviously,2/2/2019,51
when it got to nothing,2/2/2019,51
yeah and they blown to by yeah you know,2/2/2019,51
what's easy to get a little bit of,2/2/2019,51
rattle I didn't think he did oh I,2/2/2019,51
thought her team at that point really,2/2/2019,51
thought we were playing well I thought,2/2/2019,51
we had the puck a lot we're just down to,2/2/2019,51
nothing so we just stayed the course and,2/2/2019,51
were able to get it done no it was,2/2/2019,51
emotional just watching you know I don't,2/2/2019,51
have any military people in my family,2/2/2019,51
yeah and so I don't know much about it,2/2/2019,51
but yeah pretty special when you have,2/2/2019,51
two little kids out there and they get,2/2/2019,51
the spear dad walk out and obviously,2/2/2019,51
just the reaction of his wife so I don't,2/2/2019,51
know I thought it was really cool well I,2/2/2019,51
thought we had a real good matchup to,2/2/2019,51
hearse,2/2/2019,51
yeah obviously with Hyman and Mitchie,2/2/2019,51
were dialed in and really skating and,2/2/2019,51
obviously was Muzzin more on the back I,2/2/2019,51
thought we had a good five some I mean,2/2/2019,51
Doolin and litang played with those guys,2/2/2019,51
so it was good hockey when those guys,2/2/2019,51
were on the ice that's ten really good,2/2/2019,51
hockey players and we were fortunate,2/2/2019,51
that you know we were able to keep on,2/2/2019,51
top and keep it out for the most part,2/2/2019,51
it's just you know what I don't know if,2/2/2019,51
we're is gonna play you know we'll,2/2/2019,51
figure that out over time well we'll get,2/2/2019,51
the match or we'll get it so that we,2/2/2019,51
have best pairs but you know suddenly,2/2/2019,51
you were way deeper just I thought,2/2/2019,51
German had one of his best games playing,2/2/2019,51
with haensi to talking to him helping,2/2/2019,51
him I can really do that for you so,2/2/2019,51
suddenly were way deeper on the back for,2/2/2019,51
sure we you know on ozone face off and,2/2/2019,51
stuff like that we talked about we will,2/2/2019,51
always want Monier there's the puck and,2/2/2019,51
so they're gonna have a lot where they,2/2/2019,51
play either side you know that's just,2/2/2019,51
over time they'll figure that out,2/2/2019,51
between the two of them obviously and,2/2/2019,51
then we'll just watch as it goes on,2/2/2019,51
sometimes your your best plans don't,2/2/2019,51
work out like that we'll just see what,2/2/2019,51
suits the hockey club the best say,2/2/2019,51
you're obviously Moe's is a big man and,2/2/2019,51
he's not flashy but he's intelligent,2/2/2019,51
he's calm he's got a real good puck,2/2/2019,51
skills got a good shot but he's a big,2/2/2019,51
body and plays really hard in between,2/2/2019,51
the whistles and we don't have enough,2/2/2019,51
lot and so that gives us another guy,2/2/2019,51
that can do that so that's real positive,2/2/2019,51
the second one was you know yeah I mean,2/2/2019,51
obviously been with our organization for,2/2/2019,51
a long time is real good man and you,2/2/2019,51
always hope those guys the best I don't,2/2/2019,51
know exactly the timeline on that annoys,2/2/2019,51
skated real well today in his testing as,2/2/2019,51
far as coming back you know he they,2/2/2019,51
always tell you I'm ready I'm ready I'm,2/2/2019,51
ready but that doesn't mean they got a,2/2/2019,51
get-out-of-jail-free card yet see you,2/2/2019,51
guys,2/2/2019,51
by so many aspects of Jameson's game you,2/4/2019,52
comment on what his shot means in terms,2/4/2019,52
of opening up things down low for your,2/4/2019,52
offense well you thought tonight,2/4/2019,52
especially I mean I think we got credit,2/4/2019,52
for one power play goal we actually,2/4/2019,52
scored two just at the end of it but I,2/4/2019,52
thought his shot was important and not,2/4/2019,52
the way teams have played against on the,2/4/2019,52
power play they're basically just,2/4/2019,52
playing down low they don't respect the,2/4/2019,52
top so we're gonna have to do a better,2/4/2019,52
job with that and I thought was is area,2/4/2019,52
with his shot really helped their thing,2/4/2019,52
is I mean he's a big body you know,2/4/2019,52
what's out of play you don't want to,2/4/2019,52
Stanley Cups by accident you know how to,2/4/2019,52
play it really is good in his own zone,2/4/2019,52
denies the back makes could outlet pass,2/4/2019,52
but he's a big body and plays real hard,2/4/2019,52
between the whistles and obviously with,2/4/2019,52
his experience and the kind of man he is,2/4/2019,52
he's gonna make us better team well I,2/4/2019,52
mean obviously real good you know so if,2/4/2019,52
you you go back over Johnny's career,2/4/2019,52
here with the Leafs he started that same,2/4/2019,52
way every year so we are gonna have to,2/4/2019,52
change something there but obviously,2/4/2019,52
he's a good player he's got a tenacity,2/4/2019,52
makes people mad out there which I like,2/4/2019,52
he goes in the the hard areas and not,2/4/2019,52
scared to go in the hard areas and,2/4/2019,52
that's why he has the puck a lot and you,2/4/2019,52
know we obviously had himself a good,2/4/2019,52
night,2/4/2019,52
well I mean obviously confidence you,2/4/2019,52
know I mean he's got the ability as we,2/4/2019,52
all know and we think he has a chance to,2/4/2019,52
be real important player for us you just,2/4/2019,52
got to get his confidence back,2/4/2019,52
but you get a confidence back by working,2/4/2019,52
and competing and doing good things and,2/4/2019,52
next thing you know you're rewarded so,2/4/2019,52
good for him there's no question about,2/4/2019,52
it it's like anybody who's a scorer,2/4/2019,52
you know I mean all I got to do is even,2/4/2019,52
look at a guy like Matthews who went,2/4/2019,52
through a period there was his core and,2/4/2019,52
as soon as they score it's like,2/4/2019,52
adrenaline for them you know and then,2/4/2019,52
you see it in their play in their jump,2/4/2019,52
you've seen her a lot he just didn't hit,2/4/2019,52
the net so you know but when he hits the,2/4/2019,52
net he's dangerous he can shoot the puck,2/4/2019,52
and he's got skill he can make plays he,2/4/2019,52
can transport the puck he can be,2/4/2019,52
dangerous all over his good in the face,2/4/2019,52
officer it was a real good hockey player,2/4/2019,52
and and that's what we have,2/4/2019,52
let's hated all those momentum changes,2/6/2019,53
when you got the start you wanted well,2/6/2019,53
probably turnovers you know I mean the,2/6/2019,53
bottom line is I thought we were really,2/6/2019,53
ready to play,2/6/2019,53
I thought we started that we're playing,2/6/2019,53
well and then we just got careless and,2/6/2019,53
we never really seemed to be able to get,2/6/2019,53
it back at the same time it is you know,2/6/2019,53
when you're good team in your winning,2/6/2019,53
game sometimes they're not very pretty,2/6/2019,53
but you still want them so at the end,2/6/2019,53
when we get up tomorrow in the standings,2/6/2019,53
it's gonna look pretty good Wow he,2/6/2019,53
played hard you know we did a good job,2/6/2019,53
plays hard most of the time it's nice to,2/6/2019,53
see guys rewarded but you know what,2/6/2019,53
I thought goats line was real good,2/6/2019,53
tonight too I thought Little John got,2/6/2019,53
his coin there in a second when the,2/6/2019,53
wheels came off I thought that was that,2/6/2019,53
was good I mean Freddy at one point I,2/6/2019,53
had to make a few saves in a row so we,2/6/2019,53
found we we found a way to win a game I,2/6/2019,53
didn't think help started great I,2/6/2019,53
thought we're organized I look good and,2/6/2019,53
then in the end weren't as good as we,2/6/2019,53
wanted to be but I think suddenly know,2/6/2019,53
we got points in five straight then seem,2/6/2019,53
to be going in the right direction,2/6/2019,53
when you start making the sieve when,2/6/2019,53
you're laying on your back and the pucks,2/6/2019,53
behind the net is probably gonna be ugly,2/6/2019,53
but he kept it out so good for him,2/6/2019,53
what aspect of your clubs performance,2/9/2019,54
here tonight Mike impressed you that in,2/9/2019,54
the end enabled them to win in a tough,2/9/2019,54
building,2/9/2019,54
well obviously the penalty kill was real,2/9/2019,54
good our fourth line was outstanding,2/9/2019,54
basically you don't got us two of the,2/9/2019,54
goals and you know we found a way to,2/9/2019,54
just hang around hanging around and,2/9/2019,54
ended up winning the game so good game,2/9/2019,54
to win and I thought it was tightly,2/9/2019,54
contested I thought there was no room,2/9/2019,54
either way and in the end we found a way,2/9/2019,54
to win well they were physical they,2/9/2019,54
played right they were competitive to,2/9/2019,54
put the puck in and they got on the,2/9/2019,54
cycle you know they just scored and then,2/9/2019,54
Himes was up with him what they end up,2/9/2019,54
living goal there and then you know set,2/9/2019,54
up another one I thought they did a real,2/9/2019,54
good job every shift they played and we,2/9/2019,54
played him a lock they were good well,2/9/2019,54
ank tonight will be a real confidence,2/9/2019,54
builder forum you know anytime it's nice,2/9/2019,54
to score and big moments to important,2/9/2019,54
moments and you feel good about yourself,2/9/2019,54
so good for Willie and I mean a great,2/9/2019,54
shot we need him to hit the net a little,2/9/2019,54
bit more and you score a lot more but,2/9/2019,54
that was important though for us got us,2/9/2019,54
right back we answered back quick and,2/9/2019,54
and so you know you're not thinking,2/9/2019,54
negative thoughts you're just right back,2/9/2019,54
at it so I thought that was positive,2/9/2019,54
that's very captain and pushing it as,2/9/2019,54
well do you see him maybe on the verge,2/9/2019,54
of maybe breaking through just given how,2/9/2019,54
offensive he has been well I just think,2/9/2019,54
you know that line is a chance to be a,2/9/2019,54
real good line and obviously we think,2/9/2019,54
that line can be a dominant line every,2/9/2019,54
night and so we need more other group,2/9/2019,54
but you know that's why you're on a team,2/9/2019,54
you got four lines and you pick each,2/9/2019,54
other up the night tonight well I could,2/9/2019,54
spectacular every night here but you,2/9/2019,54
know in fairness to the fans when we,2/9/2019,54
played them when I first got to Toronto,2/9/2019,54
we were no good and then they had her,2/9/2019,54
down your last year so we've never,2/9/2019,54
really played a good team playing a good,2/9/2019,54
team in the season word matter and so,2/9/2019,54
you know tonight was a little different,2/9/2019,54
story obviously the crowd was fired up,2/9/2019,54
under most people I've ever seen here,2/9/2019,54
and warm up and they were ready to go,2/9/2019,54
tonight,2/9/2019,54
yeah I mean we I would say we had the,2/10/2019,55
puck the majority of the time obviously,2/10/2019,55
I've quality quality chances I thought,2/10/2019,55
their goaltender had a good night and,2/10/2019,55
you know we missed lots of opportunity,2/10/2019,55
and saying that was a game you know we'd,2/10/2019,55
like to win we thought we had good legs,2/10/2019,55
we thought we had pretty good execution,2/10/2019,55
and but on the other side sometimes you,2/10/2019,55
know you still want to jakoli plays real,2/10/2019,55
good and and he steals your game so I,2/10/2019,55
think probably over the long season that,2/10/2019,55
it evens out doesn't make you feel any,2/10/2019,55
better on the night but that's the way,2/10/2019,55
it is well I thought the power play was,2/10/2019,55
really good you know I mean I did score,2/10/2019,55
but it would be pretty hard to look at,2/10/2019,55
that power play and not say it wasn't,2/10/2019,55
good so I think I'll be good for our,2/10/2019,55
guys to go throw with them too and,2/10/2019,55
understand they had good looks and good,2/10/2019,55
opportunities and you know in the end,2/10/2019,55
when you do good things good things,2/10/2019,55
happen over time why I mean there was,2/10/2019,55
lots of chances on the power play,2/10/2019,55
obviously but you know I thought we had,2/10/2019,55
a lot of good players here tonight we,2/10/2019,55
didn't use our fourth line as much,2/10/2019,55
before chasing the game but I thought we,2/10/2019,55
had you know it's not like a go through,2/10/2019,55
it and say this guy didn't play good,2/10/2019,55
that's me that wasn't the case we played,2/10/2019,55
good well I mean as long as he doesn't,2/10/2019,55
hurt his hand I don't care at all you,2/10/2019,55
know I mean he's a good player and,2/10/2019,55
obviously can do that but you know I,2/10/2019,55
think it's important to stand up for one,2/10/2019,55
another but I also want them healthy and,2/10/2019,55
plain,2/10/2019,55
unbelievable you know as long as he,2/12/2019,56
keeps winning he gets to stay tuned you,2/12/2019,56
better ever get that out in the airwaves,2/12/2019,56
well for sure I mean there for a while,2/12/2019,56
obviously it was going bad we weren't,2/12/2019,56
doing good things when you don't do good,2/12/2019,56
things good things don't happen but when,2/12/2019,56
you start to do good things again and,2/12/2019,56
you get competitive I thought to beerus,2/12/2019,56
made some unbelievable plays on tell you,2/12/2019,56
the truth but it was great to see our,2/12/2019,56
guys be rewarded it gives them a bit of,2/12/2019,56
swagger back and obviously it was a,2/12/2019,56
difference in the game,2/12/2019,56
well exactly so what we try to do is,2/12/2019,56
just basically we want a little bit we,2/12/2019,56
wanted him to play I mean we got,2/12/2019,56
structure we got our scheme for sure but,2/12/2019,56
we want him to play and the biggest,2/12/2019,56
thing we haven't done anything lately is,2/12/2019,56
there's been no plays no speed and you,2/12/2019,56
know I think when you're pressing those,2/12/2019,56
things happen but this happens every,2/12/2019,56
once in a while and you got to fight,2/12/2019,56
your way through it it's just like,2/12/2019,56
anything dig in and it could happen and,2/12/2019,56
I thought the guys did a good job well,2/12/2019,56
we just you know we did it again the,2/12/2019,56
other night and you know it was one of,2/12/2019,56
those things we didn't like our first,2/12/2019,56
bar play with that group and so we just,2/12/2019,56
tried it and good for him I thought,2/12/2019,56
Kathy was real strong for us tonight I,2/12/2019,56
thought the Matthews line to dominate,2/12/2019,56
the game and I thought that he was,2/12/2019,56
particularly really good well my dear,2/12/2019,56
this isn't like this which other deep,2/12/2019,56
airs a bit nervous well just because we,2/12/2019,56
didn't like you all we broke out the,2/12/2019,56
first period you know I mean as a group,2/12/2019,56
when we knew coming in with altitude and,2/12/2019,56
we traveled we got in really late we,2/12/2019,56
knew we're gonna struggle we talked,2/12/2019,56
about the first 10 minutes trying to,2/12/2019,56
survive and we were able to get the goal,2/12/2019,56
and do that didn't break out it's also,2/12/2019,56
something we've talked quite a bit about,2/12/2019,56
just because we think most should play,2/12/2019,56
on the left we think he provides way,2/12/2019,56
more often sway more shots and he's,2/12/2019,56
better player over there so it's,2/12/2019,56
important to have your best guys playing,2/12/2019,56
their best spots I talked too much about,2/12/2019,56
it earlier anyway I'm not saying that's,2/12/2019,56
gonna be next game but that's what we,2/12/2019,56
did tonight you're definitely,2/12/2019,56
well I you know with six pretty good,2/12/2019,56
guys there and so I just think that it's,2/12/2019,56
a good situation we'll figure it out,2/12/2019,56
over time what the right way is to do it,2/12/2019,56
right now we're just a work in progress,2/12/2019,56
well I mean it was good night for now,2/12/2019,56
and obviously we'll have ate some,2/12/2019,56
unbelievable plays it was good for,2/12/2019,56
Willie to I don't know many points will,2/12/2019,56
he had a couple for sure,2/12/2019,56
but I thought the assists that he made,2/12/2019,56
on the power play and then the one,2/12/2019,56
they're late to now is was great play,2/12/2019,56
like clubs drawn 19 power place in the,2/14/2019,57
for games how important especially in a,2/14/2019,57
building like this step to get things,2/14/2019,57
equalized after they came at you the way,2/14/2019,57
they did opening a few minutes yeah you,2/14/2019,57
know I just thought we played I thought,2/14/2019,57
we played a good game to be honest with,2/14/2019,57
you I would control the puck a ton we,2/14/2019,57
spent a lot of time in Arizona so we,2/14/2019,57
were able to drop points as I see the,2/14/2019,57
power play work kid and you know guys,2/14/2019,57
like this course well that's a good,2/14/2019,57
thing although we had a real good third,2/14/2019,57
to as well as when the game seemed like,2/14/2019,57
it was slipping away and we're able as,2/14/2019,57
for so it was good night for a team what,2/14/2019,57
you think you know this last three games,2/14/2019,57
has been his best games in a long time,2/14/2019,57
and he's really skating and the more he,2/14/2019,57
skates the more he has the puck and goes,2/14/2019,57
in you know those things happen during,2/14/2019,57
the year you know where it comes and,2/14/2019,57
goes but I thought he was dominant the,2/14/2019,57
last three games for us really dominant,2/14/2019,57
and obviously the more dominant he is,2/14/2019,57
then suddenly with John's lines playing,2/14/2019,57
the way you have to real bomb and it,2/14/2019,57
centers it makes it hard for the other,2/14/2019,57
team and he's got to be feeling good,2/14/2019,57
about himself in the way his plan,2/14/2019,57
Johnson no you know obviously we hope,2/14/2019,57
he's okay you know they'll be doing,2/14/2019,57
everything precautionary we'll look at,2/14/2019,57
it tomorrow and see what goes on in us,2/14/2019,57
is dying to get in anyway I think,2/14/2019,57
you mentioned this morning the way they,2/16/2019,58
play they came as advertised you prepare,2/16/2019,58
for it but it's still tough to play,2/16/2019,58
against well I thought we came out I,2/16/2019,58
thought we started real good we own the,2/16/2019,58
puck for eight straight minutes that was,2/16/2019,58
it for the night next 52 or theirs they,2/16/2019,58
played harder they were above the puck,2/16/2019,58
they did things right they did exactly,2/16/2019,58
what we said they were going to do and,2/16/2019,58
we create a plan to to have success,2/16/2019,58
against them we didn't work hard enough,2/16/2019,58
to make that out well I thought we,2/16/2019,58
started good I thought we started good,2/16/2019,58
but the bottom line is when they did it,2/16/2019,58
right we didn't stick with it and in the,2/16/2019,58
end you can't win so you know obviously,2/16/2019,58
we've been playing real well so that's,2/16/2019,58
disappointing you got to give them,2/16/2019,58
credit I thought talk did a good job and,2/16/2019,58
had his team organized I mean they did,2/16/2019,58
exactly what we told her guys were gonna,2/16/2019,58
they're going to do in the end we didn't,2/16/2019,58
execute at a high enough level and work,2/16/2019,58
at a high enough level to have success,2/16/2019,58
tonight,2/16/2019,58
know what else tonight tonight aside,2/16/2019,58
tonight aside you've managed to put up a,2/16/2019,58
great deal of points in the last we've,2/16/2019,58
played well we played well we played,2/16/2019,58
well on this road trip I like the way we,2/16/2019,58
played we played with good energy good,2/16/2019,58
detail good work ethic we just weren't,2/16/2019,58
as good tonight the sun's gonna get up,2/16/2019,58
tomorrow and we're gonna get back to,2/16/2019,58
work goes obviously I don't think,2/16/2019,58
anybody he interviewed tonight could,2/16/2019,58
have been feeling that good about well,2/16/2019,58
he's a real good person you know I don't,2/16/2019,58
know if you've met his mum and dad and,2/16/2019,58
his family they're real good people I,2/16/2019,58
think today it's a real good thing for,2/16/2019,58
Arizona obviously one of their native,2/16/2019,58
sons comes home and not only is a real,2/16/2019,58
good player is a real good person I mean,2/16/2019,58
our team wasn't good tonight obviously,2/16/2019,58
so I'll be disappointing for him he's,2/16/2019,58
probably got a huge contingent there and,2/16/2019,58
would like to be there celebrating with,2/16/2019,58
them but you always feel the same after,2/16/2019,58
a loss so we should feel like we feel,2/16/2019,58
well I mean there's no reason you want,2/16/2019,58
to take advantage of it we're here in a,2/16/2019,58
good spot enjoy that we're going to the,2/16/2019,58
st. Louis they're playing real well,2/16/2019,58
we're obviously gonna have to be,2/16/2019,58
prepared well that's what I know in life,2/16/2019,58
and you don't do more than we did,2/16/2019,58
tonight it never goes your way so oh,2/16/2019,58
don't worry about it move on,2/16/2019,58
and what I didn't get an update on him,2/16/2019,58
today but I saw him howling and their,2/16/2019,58
boat noon today he was laughing and,2/16/2019,58
joking around I thought life must be,2/16/2019,58
alright,2/16/2019,58
what did you like about the latter two,2/19/2019,59
periods - at least were able to get back,2/19/2019,59
into this game and at least secure the,2/19/2019,59
point that you did get tonight yeah I,2/19/2019,59
thought they played harder at the start,2/19/2019,59
than we did,2/19/2019,59
I didn't mind her right away but then as,2/19/2019,59
the period went on the first they took,2/19/2019,59
the period over and played her - won the,2/19/2019,59
battles won the races,2/19/2019,59
and I thought we got the game going real,2/19/2019,59
well and the second period and the third,2/19/2019,59
period obviously you know they had three,2/19/2019,59
power plays we had none and so I thought,2/19/2019,59
that was a factor in the game I like to,2/19/2019,59
seen us crawl our way back and win the,2/19/2019,59
game but I thought we did a lot of good,2/19/2019,59
things here today in the latter half of,2/19/2019,59
that game to set ourselves up for,2/19/2019,59
success and I was impressed with a lot,2/19/2019,59
of her players good for a couple shifts,2/19/2019,59
maybe not as good defensively in the,2/19/2019,59
third period thought it was good,2/19/2019,59
defensively and offensively no was a,2/19/2019,59
factor in the game you know we had some,2/19/2019,59
good looks where we missed the net and I,2/19/2019,59
thought Willie and the cap were two of,2/19/2019,59
those guys in that area but I thought he,2/19/2019,59
played well when it came in after the,2/19/2019,59
first period mag was the first yea the,2/19/2019,59
first period so there used I didn't know,2/19/2019,59
what was going on or nothing like that,2/19/2019,59
but obviously you know we've got bumped,2/19/2019,59
into so whatever they do here in these,2/19/2019,59
situations yeah I liked a road trip a,2/19/2019,59
lot I didn't like her game in Phoenix,2/19/2019,59
other non-elect her game every night I,2/19/2019,59
mean I would have liked to have a better,2/19/2019,59
first year and yet to get to give them,2/19/2019,59
credit for a good team playing well,2/19/2019,59
their big long team on the back you know,2/19/2019,59
when you're long like that you create a,2/19/2019,59
lot of turnovers just because you take,2/19/2019,59
up so much space but I thought you know,2/19/2019,59
I liked a road trip with the exception,2/19/2019,59
of the game in Phoenix did you like what,2/19/2019,59
the club's ability to compete track down,2/19/2019,59
pucks and force the transition game of,2/19/2019,59
it well I just thought as we got digging,2/19/2019,59
in and competing at a high level I mean,2/19/2019,59
the game so simple is if you work hard,2/19/2019,59
you get rewarded if you don't work hard,2/19/2019,59
enough that you don't end and when,2/19/2019,59
you're playing real good teams you got,2/19/2019,59
to be ready to go right to start tell me,2/19/2019,59
we weren't at their level at the start,2/19/2019,59
and in the end probably cost us a point,2/19/2019,59
but I still like I like a lot of things,2/19/2019,59
we did today and it's good stuff dirty,2/19/2019,59
hello I've seen to like pretty much most,2/21/2019,60
of the game here tonight obviously or,2/21/2019,60
things they didn't like beyond the,2/21/2019,60
shorthand at Google was there much to,2/21/2019,60
separate both these teams well I mean I,2/21/2019,60
thought I thought the second goal was a,2/21/2019,60
gift we had no one in front of net no,2/21/2019,60
it's a freebie soul and even being,2/21/2019,60
honest their shorthand goal I thought we,2/21/2019,60
could have sorted that oh so you'd like,2/21/2019,60
to have that was back you don't want to,2/21/2019,60
you can tote score your defensive,2/21/2019,60
mistakes good defensively we had lots of,2/21/2019,60
great looks as you saw lots of good,2/21/2019,60
opportunity here no question about it,2/21/2019,60
actually skated probably better than I I,2/21/2019,60
thought after coming back off the trip,2/21/2019,60
but the bottom line is you got to get,2/21/2019,60
points and we suddenly got one in in,2/21/2019,60
three games and so we got to get herself,2/21/2019,60
energized tomorrow and back at it and,2/21/2019,60
find a way to win hockey that line was,2/21/2019,60
very good I wasn't trying to take,2/21/2019,60
anything away from Willie I thought,2/21/2019,60
johnny was really jumping and you know I,2/21/2019,60
thought that would help out and you know,2/21/2019,60
when the end Johnny had a real strong,2/21/2019,60
game for us you know and so that's what,2/21/2019,60
we thought we'd do score,2/21/2019,60
I'd like the way we've played most,2/21/2019,60
nights here to be honest with you so I,2/21/2019,60
usually find overtime you do good things,2/21/2019,60
good things happen so I'm not as,2/21/2019,60
concerned about it I thought we had like,2/21/2019,60
I said exceptional looks I mean Mitch,2/21/2019,60
alone home-free twice there at the end I,2/21/2019,60
thought Ruger look Maddie and home-free,2/21/2019,60
in the second copy great chance with,2/21/2019,60
Johnny and then that those are crazy,2/21/2019,60
looks and that we didn't score I mean to,2/21/2019,60
me if you get those chances they go in,2/21/2019,60
eventually,2/21/2019,60
well I'm not promising anything because,2/21/2019,60
I've watched a tape or nothing but I,2/21/2019,60
thought his game was real good I think,2/21/2019,60
Johnny's been playing well and you know,2/21/2019,60
he's a guy who's tenacious he's on the,2/21/2019,60
puck he's got good detail and he seems,2/21/2019,60
to have hands around the net and he,2/21/2019,60
finds ways to score,2/21/2019,60
Mike did you see signs in the opening,2/23/2019,61
period as tough as it was that your club,2/23/2019,61
still had enough and obviously what it,2/23/2019,61
took to to get the job done eventually,2/23/2019,61
well I thought we started fantastic I,2/23/2019,61
thought the first eight minutes were I,2/23/2019,61
don't know for the skating fast remove,2/23/2019,61
the puck any better but when they scored,2/23/2019,61
for whatever reason yeah we lost,2/23/2019,61
composure there for a bit,2/23/2019,61
even their power play goal I mean we're,2/23/2019,61
running in the right spots and you know,2/23/2019,61
we're able to get in the room and get,2/23/2019,61
regrouped and you know we had a lot of,2/23/2019,61
belief in our team we think we've got a,2/23/2019,61
good team and talked about having lots,2/23/2019,61
of hockey better start doing things,2/23/2019,61
right Freddie had a real good sequence,2/23/2019,61
in the second period or they could,2/23/2019,61
probably put the game on a reach I don't,2/23/2019,61
know what the score was at that time to,2/23/2019,61
be honest with you but I thought he did,2/23/2019,61
a good job there and you know sometimes,2/23/2019,61
as a goalie when three go by you it's,2/23/2019,61
hard to hold your composure and make the,2/23/2019,61
next save but I thought he did a good,2/23/2019,61
job and and that was a huge part of,2/23/2019,61
having success to me,2/23/2019,61
that we started great we've lost their,2/23/2019,61
composure we can get it back there's,2/23/2019,61
lots of hockey it's Saturday night it's,2/23/2019,61
in our house it's guaranteed win night,2/23/2019,61
let's win you know I'm not sometimes you,2/23/2019,61
can go through video we do so much,2/23/2019,61
analytics now and you got all these,2/23/2019,61
things that tell you how great it is and,2/23/2019,61
you know we're entered the zone this,2/23/2019,61
many times when this when you faceoff,2/23/2019,61
had this many attempts I like goals he's,2/23/2019,61
a good player I thought he was,2/23/2019,61
exceptional as the game went on tonight,2/23/2019,61
really good I thought physical on,2/23/2019,61
offense and really determined and really,2/23/2019,61
solid defensively I was very impressed,2/23/2019,61
with him but obviously a big goal for us,2/23/2019,61
I thought it was real good play by,2/23/2019,61
Willie instead of carrying him down the,2/23/2019,61
flank he just made a play,2/23/2019,61
very quickly the created space,2/23/2019,61
underneath for Marlowe and Ennis bury it,2/23/2019,61
so I mean that was a big part in the,2/23/2019,61
game obviously and and you need your,2/23/2019,61
specialty teams to be good we had a huge,2/23/2019,61
kill in the third period that helped us,2/23/2019,61
as well it's a good win for our team,2/23/2019,61
when it's three nothing and they got to,2/23/2019,61
turn the music on loud because they're,2/23/2019,61
scared what the fans will say that's,2/23/2019,61
always you know not a great feeling even,2/23/2019,61
though we thought we were I thought we,2/23/2019,61
were really prepared like we really,2/23/2019,61
jumped and but it just goes to show you,2/23/2019,61
when you're young sometimes and it's a,2/23/2019,61
big game you get a little off kilter,2/23/2019,61
sometimes when you shouldn't you should,2/23/2019,61
just say steady on the rudder and keep,2/23/2019,61
getting her done well the second goal,2/23/2019,61
was huge for us obviously you know once,2/23/2019,61
we got it to within one and you're set,2/23/2019,61
up for the third and it's in your,2/23/2019,61
building like I said you know we like,2/23/2019,61
our hockey team we think we've got a,2/23/2019,61
good hockey club and so then for sure,2/23/2019,61
obviously we're in a good spot,2/23/2019,61
these two teams gross has he been here,2/23/2019,61
well I mean not to start the first thing,2/23/2019,61
we were no good so pretty hard to have a,2/23/2019,61
rivalry and then last year they had a,2/23/2019,61
downturn of webbed and carry price,2/23/2019,61
weren't available and and they've made a,2/23/2019,61
number of changes now it's the first,2/23/2019,61
time we've played when both teams are,2/23/2019,61
good good hockey team since I've been,2/23/2019,61
here in the four years so that's,2/23/2019,61
probably the biggest difference,2/23/2019,61
how much of a catalyst Mike was the,2/25/2019,62
fourth line tonight getting things going,2/25/2019,62
for you guys in that second period well,2/25/2019,62
for sure I mean I obviously had a tough,2/25/2019,62
start and so you know was good I thought,2/25/2019,62
more really brought energy that group,2/25/2019,62
played with a lot of pace here tonight,2/25/2019,62
and and helped us a lot in the end you,2/25/2019,62
know responsible for two ghouls so,2/25/2019,62
that's a real good thing well I just,2/25/2019,62
think I think what you do every year as,2/25/2019,62
a management team is is no one on the,2/25/2019,62
outside ever knows what really goes on,2/25/2019,62
and what you do is you do everything you,2/25/2019,62
can to help your team and in the end you,2/25/2019,62
make the best decisions you possibly can,2/25/2019,62
to help your club and you always got a,2/25/2019,62
you know it's you always gotta weigh the,2/25/2019,62
cost the way you're doing and so we're,2/25/2019,62
ecstatic to have the opportunity that we,2/25/2019,62
have we like our team we still think,2/25/2019,62
there's that kind of growth from within,2/25/2019,62
we think we can play a lot better and,2/25/2019,62
we'll look for clucked I think more can,2/25/2019,62
really help our hockey club ya know I,2/25/2019,62
don't know the patan kid is good but,2/25/2019,62
we're excited to have him and we can see,2/25/2019,62
what he can do and then the group we,2/25/2019,62
have from within but we really feel we,2/25/2019,62
can play a lot better and and look,2/25/2019,62
forward for the opportunity show that,2/25/2019,62
ready torches game over of course what,2/25/2019,62
we're gonna find out now because you get,2/25/2019,62
an opportunity and it's got to be every,2/25/2019,62
night Freddy's got to become a good,2/25/2019,62
faceoff guy for us and apparently,2/25/2019,62
killers got to be a guy you can put on,2/25/2019,62
in the defensive zone and not worry,2/25/2019,62
about who the other team's coming with,2/25/2019,62
that's important and so you know,2/25/2019,62
obviously he's come a long way in the,2/25/2019,62
three or four years I don't know is,2/25/2019,62
three or four or whatever he's been,2/25/2019,62
around and but he's got a long way to go,2/25/2019,62
and but if as long as he competes he's a,2/25/2019,62
big man she'sshe on the defensive side,2/25/2019,62
of the puck we're trying to get as much,2/25/2019,62
speed as we can around him and because,2/25/2019,62
that's important for him and go from,2/25/2019,62
there,2/25/2019,62
well for sure and I you know there's two,2/25/2019,62
parts as it means a crime and we'd like,2/25/2019,62
to have you know one on each line but,2/25/2019,62
they just don't make them like that and,2/25/2019,62
so I think Little John has come a long,2/25/2019,62
way in that area we need copy to do more,2/25/2019,62
of that but we have a lot of guys Willie,2/25/2019,62
can really cycle the park and he needs,2/25/2019,62
to commit to doing it Matthews is way,2/25/2019,62
more physical on offense than he used to,2/25/2019,62
be and that's important as well and we,2/25/2019,62
just need to continue to grow that,2/25/2019,62
throughout their group I think more for,2/25/2019,62
the size of them as real you know got a,2/25/2019,62
heavy keister and hangs on a puck pretty,2/25/2019,62
good there and so we need more of that,2/25/2019,62
probably seen wrote that,2/25/2019,62
well I just think you know I went alone,2/25/2019,62
last year meant with Freddie and his mom,2/25/2019,62
and dad and his family there and we,2/25/2019,62
talked a ton about that is the,2/25/2019,62
leadership has nothing to do with what,2/25/2019,62
you say I really believe that has to do,2/25/2019,62
with what you do and how you are in the,2/25/2019,62
big moments how you are every day how,2/25/2019,62
hard you compete how mentally tough you,2/25/2019,62
are as a goaltender and so that's the,2/25/2019,62
challenge for him every day and in the,2/25/2019,62
end your goaltender has to be one of,2/25/2019,62
your best players if not your best for,2/25/2019,62
you to have success in the end and so,2/25/2019,62
that's the challenge for him and he's,2/25/2019,62
excited about the opportunity,2/25/2019,62
German hurt his shoulder gonna be,2/27/2019,63
probably week to week he already saw the,2/27/2019,63
released gardeners week to week hello,2/27/2019,63
yeah we're gonna call someone up we'll,2/27/2019,63
call up mer ensign and then just because,2/27/2019,63
he hasn't played any games here lately,2/27/2019,63
going back to back probably not a good,2/27/2019,63
idea so put Marty and haul her in,2/27/2019,63
tomorrow and then we'll just work out a,2/27/2019,63
rotation as time goes on here I mean,2/27/2019,63
these are gonna be the D for a while,2/27/2019,63
Rosen's not available in the artists,2/27/2019,63
foot so those are the guns available,2/27/2019,63
I've been fortunate this year Mike and,2/27/2019,63
you've hit a rash of injuries right now,2/27/2019,63
is that what's another opportunity do,2/27/2019,63
you look at it that way well you know,2/27/2019,63
what else gonna do I mean the bottom,2/27/2019,63
line is someone's gonna get a chance,2/27/2019,63
we'll find a player or maybe a good,2/27/2019,63
player maybe a better pair than we had,2/27/2019,63
planned and go from there but our Ford's,2/27/2019,63
got to do a better job now make sure we,2/27/2019,63
don't spend much time in obviously I,2/27/2019,63
like I like to attract transition goals,2/27/2019,63
because they're that means you're,2/27/2019,63
working and you're competing hard that,2/27/2019,63
and that way you know obviously it's,2/27/2019,63
good to have the power play go on I,2/27/2019,63
didn't like curse started as much as you,2/27/2019,63
know I'd like to I thought we could have,2/27/2019,63
been better to start we didn't give up a,2/27/2019,63
ton but we still gave up too much and,2/27/2019,63
you know we just thought that we can be,2/27/2019,63
better at that area we got to be better,2/27/2019,63
tomorrow night better you know what I,2/27/2019,63
mean I haven't looked at it so I don't,2/27/2019,63
know I thought it was gonna be up,2/27/2019,63
Connelly but I mean I didn't it's not,2/27/2019,63
like a reviewed or anything,2/27/2019,63
well I think it's something he needs to,2/27/2019,63
put to bed yeah and get on with it so,2/27/2019,63
yeah I mean the great thing about fans,2/27/2019,63
is they pay their money get to say,2/27/2019,63
whatever they want oh he's a good man he,2/27/2019,63
was good for their franchise he's great,2/27/2019,63
for our franchise made a decision to,2/27/2019,63
come home I don't know if anyone could,2/27/2019,63
fault you for that no who's in charge of,2/27/2019,63
that organization and we'll have a,2/27/2019,63
button-down and there'll be none of that,2/27/2019,63
I'm not concerned about that one bit I'm,2/27/2019,63
not on social media 24/7 so I don't know,2/27/2019,63
what everyone's saying or much care to,2/27/2019,63
be honest with you we're gonna go and,2/27/2019,63
play and there's a game there's two,2/27/2019,63
points on the line yeah I couldn't tell,2/27/2019,63
you like I'm not one of those people I,2/27/2019,63
you know if somebody tells me oh I'm,2/27/2019,63
sitting right behind you yet the gamers,2/27/2019,63
either a crowd was great tonight or the,2/27/2019,63
music's really I don't know any of that,2/27/2019,63
stuff I couldn't tell you I know there's,2/27/2019,63
a game going on and what happened where,2/27/2019,63
you left it's way easier to go back when,2/27/2019,63
they fire you no it's the it's the fact,2/27/2019,63
or if they kick you out of town then no,2/27/2019,63
one holds any kind of hard feelings but,2/27/2019,63
that's life you make decisions and they,2/27/2019,63
get to say what you want you know what,2/27/2019,63
I've always said in my family if your,2/27/2019,63
knees don't hit the kitchen table your,2/27/2019,63
opinion probably doesn't matter,2/27/2019,63
yeah I mean he's been good for us for,2/27/2019,63
sure we think Freddie's elite goaltender,2/27/2019,63
we always want more to tell the truth,2/27/2019,63
where I'm at and anybody knows that's,2/27/2019,63
been in playoffs before that if you're,2/27/2019,63
gonna have success a playoff time your,2/27/2019,63
goalies got to beat that he's got to be,2/27/2019,63
mentally strong and he's got to bring it,2/27/2019,63
every night when you don't have it when,2/27/2019,63
you do have it he's just got to be good,2/27/2019,63
and that's what we expected,2/27/2019,63
Mike was it a difficult night to match,2/28/2019,64
the emotion of what they brought at you,2/28/2019,64
on a night where your club was playing,2/28/2019,64
in a back-to-back what uh you know I,2/28/2019,64
don't worry about the back-to-back I,2/28/2019,64
thought we started really well I thought,2/28/2019,64
we were playing really well and then,2/28/2019,64
like you've seen us who got impatient,2/28/2019,64
and we turned the puck over and you know,2/28/2019,64
they base their offense on track and,2/28/2019,64
backup numbers that they're lying and,2/28/2019,64
they're waiting for you to turn it over,2/28/2019,64
we didn't stay patient enough with our,2/28/2019,64
plan and in the end they capitalized and,2/28/2019,64
and then I mean in third period was,2/28/2019,64
nothing but yeah that really hurt us I,2/28/2019,64
really believe this is a lesson we have,2/28/2019,64
to learn and that's what the regular,2/28/2019,64
season is for is you got to learn these,2/28/2019,64
lessons they got more of a veteran team,2/28/2019,64
than us you can tell by the way they,2/28/2019,64
take care of the puck and we turn it,2/28/2019,64
over too much and give up too many,2/28/2019,64
transition opportunities well I think,2/28/2019,64
it's you know yeah we shouldn't return,2/28/2019,64
the puck over that's the bottom line I,2/28/2019,64
thought like I said we started good we,2/28/2019,64
played well and we had the puck and then,2/28/2019,64
we got away from it so it's a lesson we,2/28/2019,64
have to learn we're fortunate that I,2/28/2019,64
think we've got 19 games left you do,2/28/2019,64
this in the playoffs you lose you're,2/28/2019,64
done right away,2/28/2019,64
period and so you know we got these,2/28/2019,64
dress rehearsals in the meantime you got,2/28/2019,64
to get points to get in play well you,2/28/2019,64
know I don't know we'll look at the game,2/28/2019,64
here and then was he gone off go back in,2/28/2019,64
next game and then we'll just go from,2/28/2019,64
there we also have a rosin that's got a,2/28/2019,64
chance to get better and and we're gonna,2/28/2019,64
figure it out because obviously these,2/28/2019,64
guys aren't coming back right away and,2/28/2019,64
we need six goodness,2/28/2019,64
at this time it doesn't look like that,2/28/2019,64
that's what the doctors have ruled out,2/28/2019,64
but you know I don't I come not a doctor,2/28/2019,64
I don't know you go do day to day and,2/28/2019,64
has obviously got to make improvement,2/28/2019,64
and then when he makes the improvement,2/28/2019,64
they're saying he's gonna make and then,2/28/2019,64
there's gonna be no surgery whatsoever,2/28/2019,64
why thought the energy was spectacular,2/28/2019,64
and warm up there at the start of the,2/28/2019,64
game and the whole thing I mean well you,2/28/2019,64
know you must be a real special player,2/28/2019,64
and a real special person for them to,2/28/2019,64
honor you like that because the only,2/28/2019,64
Booya if you're important for most of us,2/28/2019,64
that wouldn't even know who we were and,2/28/2019,64
so what an honor that is and I thought,2/28/2019,64
our team handled that really good I,2/28/2019,64
thought would play good we started good,2/28/2019,64
to me the crowd had nothing to do with,2/28/2019,64
the old coming the game our play with,2/28/2019,64
the puck through the neutral zone at,2/28/2019,64
everything to do without outcome of the,2/28/2019,64
game and and in the end it cost us well,2/28/2019,64
you know I haven't looked at it totally,2/28/2019,64
any way you look at it they got a lot,2/28/2019,64
what did you think you knew I was going,2/28/2019,64
to handle it anyway but he's a proud guy,2/28/2019,64
and we wanted to come here and win for,2/28/2019,64
John and we didn't get that down here,2/28/2019,64
today,2/28/2019,64
we can somehow the game started prior to,3/2/2019,65
the drop of the puck and the opportunity,3/2/2019,65
for the fans to to show their their,3/2/2019,65
passion for for John and how the team,3/2/2019,65
supported in that regard,3/2/2019,65
yeah I mean I thought it was great but I,3/2/2019,65
also thought the people in New York,3/2/2019,65
showed the passion they have for John,3/2/2019,65
the other night to like I think,3/2/2019,65
sometimes again unless you're a great,3/2/2019,65
athlete unless they love you they don't,3/2/2019,65
do that so to me when you get booed on,3/2/2019,65
the road you must be something special,3/2/2019,65
that's the way I look that's all,3/2/2019,65
then he our fans obviously won the,3/2/2019,65
support in there tonight it was,3/2/2019,65
important part of our team you know you,3/2/2019,65
made a great decision for himself and,3/2/2019,65
his family to me that's how you make,3/2/2019,65
decisions in your life anyway and we're,3/2/2019,65
thrilled to have him so good for us good,3/2/2019,65
for the team to get away,3/2/2019,65
will they do it right most night so they,3/2/2019,65
played heavy they spent time in the,3/2/2019,65
offensive zone they had people at the,3/2/2019,65
net that got the puck to the paint they,3/2/2019,65
checked well and in the end they were,3/2/2019,65
rewarded so when you do good things on a,3/2/2019,65
regular basis when you're above the puck,3/2/2019,65
when you play right you end up scoring,3/2/2019,65
we're just gonna try to have the right,3/2/2019,65
people rest all the time I thought was,3/2/2019,65
really good for him were made a heck of,3/2/2019,65
a play and you know when you go to a new,3/2/2019,65
spot you're hoping it goes good for you,3/2/2019,65
right away so you can feel good about,3/2/2019,65
herself but the tire in if I played real,3/2/2019,65
well in the last five games and he,3/2/2019,65
didn't deserve to be out of the lineup,3/2/2019,65
tonight either,3/2/2019,65
so just one of those decisions and he's,3/2/2019,65
going back in next game and we'll go,3/2/2019,65
from there,3/2/2019,65
what aspects of the opening 20 minutes,3/4/2019,66
might appeal to you that allowed your,3/4/2019,66
team to set the tempo and go on to win,3/4/2019,66
this game,3/4/2019,66
well obviously we scored and so I mean,3/4/2019,66
that was good I thought to versus line,3/4/2019,66
really set the tone but you know Enzo,3/4/2019,66
had a big night for us and you know,3/4/2019,66
found waited for the puck to go in so a,3/4/2019,66
good win for our team there a good real,3/4/2019,66
good team and nice would have started,3/4/2019,66
well I really do to start to you know I,3/4/2019,66
think once the game got a little out of,3/4/2019,66
hand then it's different you're probably,3/4/2019,66
a looser you should be but I thought,3/4/2019,66
this start Freddie was ruger well,3/4/2019,66
tenacious heavy on the puck does it,3/4/2019,66
right once the stay plays like he wants,3/4/2019,66
to stay doesn't turn it over all the,3/4/2019,66
details in his game I thought he was,3/4/2019,66
really good,3/4/2019,66
11 goals for the t-virus line I think in,3/4/2019,66
the last six games it kind of smarts,3/4/2019,66
work ethic all those things well they do,3/4/2019,66
it right so they're you know of all the,3/4/2019,66
guys on our team when you do it right,3/4/2019,66
every night you're rewarded and when you,3/4/2019,66
don't and you achieve a little bit - it,3/4/2019,66
doesn't go as good for you offensively,3/4/2019,66
so I mean those guys to me they just got,3/4/2019,66
all the pieces you need on a good line,3/4/2019,66
and then they play and and they're,3/4/2019,66
professional and they're prepared and,3/4/2019,66
they work hard yeah I don't know what I,3/4/2019,66
expected you know I just when we had a,3/4/2019,66
chance to sign him in Caroline talked,3/4/2019,66
about quite a bit we just thought with,3/4/2019,66
our medical people if he could get his,3/4/2019,66
legs back and get feeling good there'd,3/4/2019,66
be an opportunity for him we bet that,3/4/2019,66
our Sports Science Group would be able,3/4/2019,66
to get him up and running and feeling,3/4/2019,66
good and you know obviously as a skill,3/4/2019,66
set you can see his hands are second to,3/4/2019,66
none and and as confidence comes when,3/4/2019,66
you've lost there takes the time to get,3/4/2019,66
back but he's got conference now I was,3/4/2019,66
important for us right you know I don't,3/4/2019,66
know I mean he's just back in Alberta,3/4/2019,66
it's the water I think,3/4/2019,66
well I just I thought they were real,3/4/2019,66
good today obviously uh you know I mean,3/4/2019,66
Rich's real good player you get to let,3/4/2019,66
get it open and getting it on the,3/4/2019,66
forecheck get him the puck back and and,3/4/2019,66
I just think the three of them work real,3/4/2019,66
well together so they've got a good,3/4/2019,66
combination,3/4/2019,66
you get the point on the road but where,3/6/2019,67
would you like to see your club better,3/6/2019,67
as you get ready to go to Edmonton,3/6/2019,67
well I just thought that I didn't think,3/6/2019,67
we started great I didn't mind I thought,3/6/2019,67
we had a real good second on any minor,3/6/2019,67
third to think you know we've got tilted,3/6/2019,67
or anything like that but anyway you,3/6/2019,67
look at we went in the period we're up,3/6/2019,67
to nothing and so we lost in overtime,3/6/2019,67
and you should find a way to win that,3/6/2019,67
game so that part's disappointing you,3/6/2019,67
know I just thought our first period,3/6/2019,67
wasn't as good I thought they're more,3/6/2019,67
urgent that we were and in the end we,3/6/2019,67
you know we I thought did a pretty good,3/6/2019,67
job to get herself set up for the one we,3/6/2019,67
weren't able actually why not the not,3/6/2019,67
the refiner and you know wait lots of,3/6/2019,67
guys that were good and you think that,3/6/2019,67
was an issue yeah so I had no concern of,3/6/2019,67
those guys well I couldn't use it as,3/6/2019,67
much in diesel which you know what I,3/6/2019,67
mean so that's you know everybody loves,3/6/2019,67
players that's great but you got to be,3/6/2019,67
able to use lines and everyone's got to,3/6/2019,67
have a role and someone's got apparently,3/6/2019,67
killing someone's got ability face offs,3/6/2019,67
and do it so I didn't think I gave our,3/6/2019,67
team without lineup is good opportunity,3/6/2019,67
as am I,3/6/2019,67
well for sure I mean in saying that we,3/6/2019,67
gave up you know what power play go off,3/6/2019,67
the rush there and give up much but,3/6/2019,67
we'll give that one up and so I think,3/6/2019,67
that's their only shot if I'm not,3/6/2019,67
mistaken on the power play I thought we,3/6/2019,67
did a pretty good job on her penalty,3/6/2019,67
kill but went in no losses going in next,3/6/2019,67
game,3/6/2019,67
well you got the first goal in each of,3/9/2019,68
the three periods in and around that,3/9/2019,68
what did you like about you team supply,3/9/2019,68
here tonight they got you the victory,3/9/2019,68
well that we played well I thought we,3/9/2019,68
had lots of guys go wandering I thought,3/9/2019,68
we control the puck we're heavy on the,3/9/2019,68
site cold did lots of really good things,3/9/2019,68
I thought Matthews line was a really,3/9/2019,68
strong played a lot against the McDavid,3/9/2019,68
group and I did a real good job,3/9/2019,68
obviously I looked out of the last two,3/9/2019,68
minutes back we couldn't figure out,3/9/2019,68
quite where to stand at the end but,3/9/2019,68
it'll give us good tape to go back and,3/9/2019,68
take a look at it and fix that so you,3/9/2019,68
know he can't give up that but i thought,3/9/2019,68
fred was real strong and so it was a,3/9/2019,68
good one and obviously five or six,3/9/2019,68
points on the road was good well just I,3/9/2019,68
mean you got to stand in the right spots,3/9/2019,68
you just got to do we know how to do,3/9/2019,68
that we know how to do it pretty well,3/9/2019,68
but if you don't stand right spots that,3/9/2019,68
make you look bad and I thought that's,3/9/2019,68
what we did no different than a five on,3/9/2019,68
three penalty kill if you're three,3/9/2019,68
people stand in the right spot is hard,3/9/2019,68
to score is the same when you're six on,3/9/2019,68
five at three people at the bottom are,3/9/2019,68
in a good spot so you know we made some,3/9/2019,68
mistakes there but it'll be a good,3/9/2019,68
learning thing for us and move on was,3/9/2019,68
cuz he just does it right every day you,3/9/2019,68
know when I think he's a real kind of,3/9/2019,68
message to everybody on our team is when,3/9/2019,68
you prepare well and you do it right,3/9/2019,68
every day you tend to get lucky every,3/9/2019,68
game and if you don't do it right you're,3/9/2019,68
hit mess and so that's why it's so,3/9/2019,68
important for our young people to be,3/9/2019,68
around him just see how he prepares and,3/9/2019,68
how he works and how intelligent he is,3/9/2019,68
and how hard he competes and in the end,3/9/2019,68
your reward yeah I was mentioning to him,3/9/2019,68
he's getting to be a bit of an old guy,3/9/2019,68
but you know what you think you arrived,3/9/2019,68
at the league you're 18 years old and,3/9/2019,68
goes in a hurry but Mo's on a guy who's,3/9/2019,68
turned himself into a high high high-end,3/9/2019,68
player in the league one of the best,3/9/2019,68
players on the back for sure and it's,3/9/2019,68
good offensively and defensively but he,3/9/2019,68
also has an elite drive train you can,3/9/2019,68
play all night and he brings it every,3/9/2019,68
day and no different and,3/9/2019,68
versus a real good probe and wants to be,3/9/2019,68
a great pro and so we're lucky to have,3/9/2019,68
what we're trying to do we're staying,3/9/2019,68
over here tonight and then flying,3/9/2019,68
tomorrow and then point in Tampa I mean,3/9/2019,68
it's they don't care where he came from,3/9/2019,68
and so we'll do everything we can to,3/9/2019,68
prepare and play well and so we're gonna,3/9/2019,68
need a real good effort town there's a,3/9/2019,68
real good team they've separated,3/9/2019,68
themselves from the group obviously and,3/9/2019,68
so we've led them all this year we just,3/9/2019,68
got to get back get energized get,3/9/2019,68
hydrated and get ready to go,3/9/2019,68
tough night for your club Mike trying to,3/11/2019,69
match competes the way Tampa brought,3/11/2019,69
their compete level I'd seen right from,3/11/2019,69
the get-go time yeah we were no good so,3/11/2019,69
they were better than us from start to,3/11/2019,69
finish it and won more battles more,3/11/2019,69
racist and just had more jump we look,3/11/2019,69
like though the third group right from,3/11/2019,69
the get-go didn't have any energy right,3/11/2019,69
through our whole group didn't skate,3/11/2019,69
well didn't execute well weren't good,3/11/2019,69
you come every day and you do everything,3/11/2019,69
you can to prepare to be as good as you,3/11/2019,69
can be and today we weren't good enough,3/11/2019,69
so we're gonna take an off day tomorrow,3/11/2019,69
get her energy level up and get ready,3/11/2019,69
we're gonna take an off day Thursday we,3/11/2019,69
just changed that and take the off day,3/11/2019,69
tomorrow get herself regrouped and get,3/11/2019,69
back on track nothing and like three had,3/11/2019,69
gone in off them I didn't think we gave,3/11/2019,69
him any opportunity I haven't looked at,3/11/2019,69
each goal I know the first two did and I,3/11/2019,69
think the third or fourth one one of,3/11/2019,69
them did so to me I didn't think it did,3/11/2019,69
him any good to be in there didn't hurt,3/11/2019,69
Sparky to get it in play and didn't look,3/11/2019,69
like we had the kind of energy or zip in,3/11/2019,69
us to turn things the other direction,3/11/2019,69
well I mean it was just easy uh you know,3/11/2019,69
Willie played with Madi in the past is,3/11/2019,69
we're looking for a willing to define,3/11/2019,69
himself there was an opportunity there,3/11/2019,69
for him,3/11/2019,69
then we just put brownie back where has,3/11/2019,69
been a bunch of times,3/11/2019,69
I thought Morsy played real well you,3/11/2019,69
know we didn't have a lot of good,3/11/2019,69
players tonight I thought Morsy was one,3/11/2019,69
on the ice for too long and they left,3/11/2019,69
him all by himself changed,3/11/2019,69
we can your third period here tonight,3/13/2019,70
possibly translate into a better start,3/13/2019,70
schoolhouse - obviously weren't very,3/13/2019,70
good in the first period,3/13/2019,70
you know the puck went in our neck yeah,3/13/2019,70
we wouldn't even look after the puck,3/13/2019,70
good enough and Capitola high enough,3/13/2019,70
flour water second period was better but,3/13/2019,70
still not good enough and obviously,3/13/2019,70
crawl their way back in the third but,3/13/2019,70
came up short and usually when you're,3/13/2019,70
down like we were it's tough to come,3/13/2019,70
back I mean I thought we made a good,3/13/2019,70
valley and push but wasn't good enough,3/13/2019,70
well we turned a park over a little bit,3/13/2019,70
you know we didn't play hard enough,3/13/2019,70
weren't quick enough in our own zone we,3/13/2019,70
didn't skate good enough compete at a,3/13/2019,70
high enough level and so you know wool,3/13/2019,70
in our preparation today for their team,3/13/2019,70
we explained how well they'd been,3/13/2019,70
playing and how hard they've been,3/13/2019,70
playing and what the level was gonna be,3/13/2019,70
and we didn't get to it so bottom line,3/13/2019,70
is we came back from the road we thought,3/13/2019,70
we're playing real wall and we haven't,3/13/2019,70
got back that level so we got to get,3/13/2019,70
back to that level,3/13/2019,70
what we did is we gave up we lost,3/13/2019,70
faceoffs the previous game and they,3/13/2019,70
bounced them off people and went in our,3/13/2019,70
net so we just did sore toes but that,3/13/2019,70
was our diesel get some puck pressure,3/13/2019,70
and D zone yeah well sure didn't look,3/13/2019,70
like it in the first looked like it,3/13/2019,70
after that but the reality is is is you,3/13/2019,70
can all stand in the right spots got to,3/13/2019,70
compete at a high enough level I just,3/13/2019,70
didn't think we started good enough I,3/13/2019,70
thought they scored on their chances,3/13/2019,70
caught us off filter and then it took us,3/13/2019,70
a while to get back going I didn't go,3/13/2019,70
through my video so once I've gone,3/13/2019,70
through them on video bill I tell you,3/13/2019,70
that tomorrow,3/13/2019,70
like how do you put a bow on that just,3/15/2019,71
synopsis what went on well well the guys,3/15/2019,71
did a heck of a job for Freddie got,3/15/2019,71
Freddie when he's done that for us a,3/15/2019,71
bunch this year and that's just payback,3/15/2019,71
and now we can move on and Sparky goes,3/15/2019,71
tomorrow but find a way to win and,3/15/2019,71
suddenly you know we're right there with,3/15/2019,71
Boston - so things tighten up there and,3/15/2019,71
give us some more opportunity I thought,3/15/2019,71
we played hard from the start tonight,3/15/2019,71
when they got ahead I thought we got a,3/15/2019,71
little careless for a few minutes other,3/15/2019,71
or not we played good well that's what,3/15/2019,71
we talked about right there we're just,3/15/2019,71
gonna win for Freddie just keep doing,3/15/2019,71
good things don't cheap I thought would,3/15/2019,71
cheetah for a few shifts right away,3/15/2019,71
they're you know kinda I don't know if,3/15/2019,71
it's panic mode or whatever and we got,3/15/2019,71
away with doing it and then we just got,3/15/2019,71
back to working and playing hard and,3/15/2019,71
playing right and in the end we won,3/15/2019,71
what's ADEA today is is I really believe,3/15/2019,71
in life adversities just speed bumps to,3/15/2019,71
get you to another level,3/15/2019,71
I believe in Freddie a lot you know our,3/15/2019,71
guys believe in him he's real good man,3/15/2019,71
takes things personal and he'll be great,3/15/2019,71
and so the mental toughness you need to,3/15/2019,71
be to go deep in the playoffs you just,3/15/2019,71
gotta have a belief in yourself you got,3/15/2019,71
to know every day when you come to,3/15/2019,71
Rincon it's gonna turn out right and,3/15/2019,71
you're gonna be great and so here's a,3/15/2019,71
little tough form I think these tests,3/15/2019,71
are great you see the chemistry between,3/15/2019,71
you,3/15/2019,71
yeah I mean you know we talked about,3/15/2019,71
chemistry the biggest part of the,3/15/2019,71
chemistry is Willie's competing and,3/15/2019,71
working and skating and and getting,3/15/2019,71
pucks and wind I mean he made an,3/15/2019,71
unbelievable play on that that one,3/15/2019,71
Google but you know on one leg when in a,3/15/2019,71
battle making a play that's what's,3/15/2019,71
happened is when we put him there before,3/15/2019,71
whether it was his conditioning whether,3/15/2019,71
it was his timing whether you know it's,3/15/2019,71
a herd leak and he wasn't ready and now,3/15/2019,71
it looks like he's ready first one they,3/15/2019,71
just shot it in two seconds what was the,3/15/2019,71
second one they did we can't again lose,3/15/2019,71
that draw I think that was I don't know,3/15/2019,71
if he saw I didn't see the last one to,3/15/2019,71
be honest with you so but you can't lose,3/15/2019,71
face offs that's the bottom line and I,3/15/2019,71
thought we sorted about fine even on the,3/15/2019,71
the one in the top corner we just you,3/15/2019,71
can't lose it that clean well I just,3/15/2019,71
think injured guy comes back take some,3/15/2019,71
time and get skating and you know I,3/15/2019,71
don't know if it had to do with you know,3/15/2019,71
negotiations or any of those things I,3/15/2019,71
don't know we're all human beings and I,3/15/2019,71
know the players when they feel great,3/15/2019,71
they play great you don't feel good you,3/15/2019,71
don't play good but you also have to,3/15/2019,71
have conditioning now the biggest thing,3/15/2019,71
with him is skating and his physical,3/15/2019,71
side of his game on offense is making,3/15/2019,71
him way better and then when you're,3/15/2019,71
skating like he is you're back there for,3/15/2019,71
defense so you're not giving anything up,3/15/2019,71
barking what else you said just an ally,3/15/2019,71
to grab an opportunity how do you think,3/15/2019,71
you wait yeah I think I mean we gave up,3/15/2019,71
six goals and so bright an awesome,3/15/2019,71
that's a good thing,3/15/2019,71
John Tavares just said Mike we've got a,3/16/2019,72
hell of a hockey club and it's just a,3/16/2019,72
matter of working through this and he's,3/16/2019,72
confident your guys will be able to do,3/16/2019,72
this maybe just a blip but four games as,3/16/2019,72
it is how do you take what happened here,3/16/2019,72
tonight and move forward from it well,3/16/2019,72
thank you I think he's a hundred percent,3/16/2019,72
but I think your ability to play every,3/16/2019,72
night is real important any way you look,3/16/2019,72
at it we've had a tough week as we,3/16/2019,72
played four games this week since,3/16/2019,72
getting back from our trip and when good,3/16/2019,72
enough and so we've given away too many,3/16/2019,72
co-hosts you can't take the puck out of,3/16/2019,72
your net like we have and have success,3/16/2019,72
bottom line is we all know how to play,3/16/2019,72
defense we all know where to stand and,3/16/2019,72
we're not doing a good enough job and,3/16/2019,72
tonight weren't good enough and you give,3/16/2019,72
them credit I thought they worked real,3/16/2019,72
hard I thought they play organized and,3/16/2019,72
and did a good job we spent too much,3/16/2019,72
time in the box and killing penalties,3/16/2019,72
that was probably the best part of our,3/16/2019,72
game to be honest with you but we,3/16/2019,72
weren't good enough well I just think,3/16/2019,72
that being a professional is getting,3/16/2019,72
ready and every day and doing your part,3/16/2019,72
so if you're sparking your jobs to stop,3/16/2019,72
the puck and if you're a team and it's,3/16/2019,72
it's the move the puck can keep it out,3/16/2019,72
so everyone just do your own job and and,3/16/2019,72
we'll all be fine I'm I think Tamara,3/16/2019,72
said it right there's you got to dig in,3/16/2019,72
and you got to do your part when you go,3/16/2019,72
through low spirits you got a worked on,3/16/2019,72
my partner and compete you're not,3/16/2019,72
sticking the structure as much as before,3/16/2019,72
when things don't quite go your way like,3/16/2019,72
you miss a chance at one ended well I,3/16/2019,72
think for sure when you're chasing the,3/16/2019,72
game a little bit to push it a little,3/16/2019,72
too much and then you've given up some,3/16/2019,72
opportunities but this week you let's be,3/16/2019,72
honest the puck spinner and are in that,3/16/2019,72
a lot you got to do a better job to keep,3/16/2019,72
it up yeah I don't know I don't think,3/16/2019,72
like that I mean it's a we had an,3/16/2019,72
opportunity to come in here and win a,3/16/2019,72
game and we were unable to get that done,3/16/2019,72
and and any way you look at it we feel,3/16/2019,72
we can play better than we play today,3/16/2019,72
and I think that's the biggest thing so,3/16/2019,72
collectively and individually you got to,3/16/2019,72
be better,3/16/2019,72
what did you see from your club here,3/19/2019,73
tonight Mike that maybe you didn't see,3/19/2019,73
in the previous four games despite the,3/19/2019,73
fact that you didn't get the result you,3/19/2019,73
might I really liked her team tonight I,3/19/2019,73
thought we worked hard I have played,3/19/2019,73
well defensively I thought we tracked I,3/19/2019,73
thought Peck arena was really good I,3/19/2019,73
didn't think we gave up much you know,3/19/2019,73
would be a game you'd like to win,3/19/2019,73
because he thought the team put in the,3/19/2019,73
effort and did things right and stayed,3/19/2019,73
patient to me it's just process if you,3/19/2019,73
do good things good things happen so,3/19/2019,73
this was a real good step for us,3/19/2019,73
especially after the week we just had,3/19/2019,73
well I mean we worked we tracked we,3/19/2019,73
stopped on defense we're inside we just,3/19/2019,73
we did everything right now yeah we also,3/19/2019,73
weren't chasing the game so it's easier,3/19/2019,73
to play right when you're not chasing,3/19/2019,73
the game our guys started good and I,3/19/2019,73
thought we played good well obviously in,3/19/2019,73
time you've been through a tough week I,3/19/2019,73
mean it was been a tough weekend goal,3/19/2019,73
for our team and and I'm not trying to,3/19/2019,73
pretend that we didn't have something to,3/19/2019,73
do with it we did which still when,3/19/2019,73
you're the goalie you want to get back,3/19/2019,73
on track and you feel good about,3/19/2019,73
yourself he's a key important player for,3/19/2019,73
us a big leader for us we need him,3/19/2019,73
feeling good so it's a good stuff we,3/19/2019,73
generated I thought we had some good,3/19/2019,73
looks and I thought better reading made,3/19/2019,73
some real good saves you know they're a,3/19/2019,73
good team they're a deep team man you,3/19/2019,73
know they're deep enough they don't have,3/19/2019,73
to overplay their players and I thought,3/19/2019,73
they played solid to me but I thought we,3/19/2019,73
did it as well too so no I was pleased,3/19/2019,73
with our effort I would like to see the,3/19/2019,73
score,3/19/2019,73
would you like about your your team,3/20/2019,74
tonight after a tough tough night last,3/20/2019,74
night energy wise on all that went with,3/20/2019,74
that well I thought we played real well,3/20/2019,74
last night and weren't rewarded in the,3/20/2019,74
end and I thought we played real well,3/20/2019,74
here tonight and we're rewarded so you,3/20/2019,74
know I like that we played hard and did,3/20/2019,74
things well and stuck together and,3/20/2019,74
played the right way,3/20/2019,74
why thought he was real good I thought,3/20/2019,74
we had lots of good players tonight,3/20/2019,74
though,3/20/2019,74
I thought young some played a real,3/20/2019,74
strong game with that was good we had,3/20/2019,74
lots of good players tonight and we had,3/20/2019,74
guys jumping right from the get-go,3/20/2019,74
obviously it's an important win for us,3/20/2019,74
he wanted to get back on track hadn't,3/20/2019,74
gone as good here this last while as,3/20/2019,74
we'd like to,3/20/2019,74
I just thought he skated and he was real,3/20/2019,74
determined a real good defensively real,3/20/2019,74
good old ffensive LY and in the end I,3/20/2019,74
thought it was a real positive,3/20/2019,74
like a hundred shots against a,3/23/2019,75
goaltender in two games and you come,3/23/2019,75
away with the point that just the nature,3/23/2019,75
of the game well and you'd like to,3/23/2019,75
finish I thought we started the first,3/23/2019,75
eight minutes I were great and think,3/23/2019,75
we're great for the next ten we had a,3/23/2019,75
real good power play to finish the,3/23/2019,75
period then I thought we really played,3/23/2019,75
well at the start of the second took,3/23/2019,75
some penalties didn't kind of get rhythm,3/23/2019,75
back I thought we had a good third we,3/23/2019,75
had lots of good players we didn't score,3/23/2019,75
yeah we had empty nuts and the whole,3/23/2019,75
works and so we got to bear down we got,3/23/2019,75
a number of guys who haven't scored in a,3/23/2019,75
bit the way I look at that usually is,3/23/2019,75
that's usually gonna change we got a,3/23/2019,75
number of guys that are like Oh for 11,3/23/2019,75
games and four and whatever or one and,3/23/2019,75
and so on those guys I mean the pucks,3/23/2019,75
gonna go in if you work hard so I,3/23/2019,75
thought we did a lot of good things,3/23/2019,75
tonight I didn't think we got in our own,3/23/2019,75
way,3/23/2019,75
you know obviously disappointing way to,3/23/2019,75
end I didn't think we're as good tonight,3/23/2019,75
as we've been in the last two games but,3/23/2019,75
I still thought we had lots of,3/23/2019,75
opportunity well I mean obviously that's,3/23/2019,75
a key thing for us and we know what it,3/23/2019,75
continues to be a huge issue not issued,3/23/2019,75
a huge thing that we have to work on to,3/23/2019,75
get better at we've talked about it,3/23/2019,75
every day and we'll continue to talk,3/23/2019,75
about it I'd like to get us a little,3/23/2019,75
more rhythm so we feel better you know,3/23/2019,75
tonight feels better if you win that's,3/23/2019,75
the bottom line,3/23/2019,75
and but you know I like the process,3/23/2019,75
we're in and I like how heard guys point,3/23/2019,75
no I know I don't know if when he played,3/23/2019,75
with Willie and Madi he was behind the,3/23/2019,75
net Warren picking more parks out and,3/23/2019,75
playing with John John does more of,3/23/2019,75
those things as well and so you end up,3/23/2019,75
shooting more but I mean all those young,3/23/2019,75
players I mean their their games just,3/23/2019,75
growing I mean if you look at all our,3/23/2019,75
young guys they continue to get better,3/23/2019,75
and we need them to get better because,3/23/2019,75
we count on them a lot so you know I,3/23/2019,75
still consider Marner and Matthews and,3/23/2019,75
time and those guys young players in the,3/23/2019,75
league but they're getting better and,3/23/2019,75
along with their kind of our next wave,3/23/2019,75
of guys sixteen shot attempts or what,3/23/2019,75
kind of kept him from breaking through,3/23/2019,75
they asked a question he had some great,3/23/2019,75
looks you know a really good looks and I,3/23/2019,75
didn't even realize after one how many,3/23/2019,75
good looks I had till i sought in the,3/23/2019,75
room and in work hard to me it's all,3/23/2019,75
processed just do good things good,3/23/2019,75
things will happen and it doesn't happen,3/23/2019,75
right away all the time but it'll happen,3/23/2019,75
I think the adversity we faced here a,3/23/2019,75
week ago yes I said at the time and I,3/23/2019,75
think it is now I think it's a good,3/23/2019,75
thing we got to dig in it's not supposed,3/23/2019,75
to be easy again,3/23/2019,75
you were reflect back to July 1st that,3/25/2019,76
warm summer afternoon John Cabarrus is,3/25/2019,76
introduced to the Toronto Maple Leafs,3/25/2019,76
and here we are and we have an idea of,3/25/2019,76
what he was all about tonight and just,3/25/2019,76
how he's been able to work in this,3/25/2019,76
market just so effective so consistent,3/25/2019,76
yeah I don't think we got that tonight,3/25/2019,76
but I mean we've been on the watch and,3/25/2019,76
see the kind of human being he is and,3/25/2019,76
how he just gets about doing his,3/25/2019,76
business and whether it plays good or,3/25/2019,76
bad he just plays there comes and does,3/25/2019,76
the same professional takes the same,3/25/2019,76
professional approach the next day so,3/25/2019,76
he's a real good leader for us and,3/25/2019,76
obviously makes us a deeper team we gave,3/25/2019,76
Maddie the assignment of barckhoff,3/25/2019,76
tonight,3/25/2019,76
normally we give it to John and so that,3/25/2019,76
freed up chalk and they had a good night,3/25/2019,76
offensively I thought Matthews line was,3/25/2019,76
outstanding,3/25/2019,76
that was a Lily's best game of the year,3/25/2019,76
[Music],3/25/2019,76
you know break away as well so it's it's,3/25/2019,76
just in general it's good to come out,3/25/2019,76
and score you know I thought we had lots,3/25/2019,76
of guys going tonight and so it was a,3/25/2019,76
good night,3/25/2019,76
well I think it's a huge thing I try to,3/25/2019,76
be cognizant of no hyman to get his 20th,3/25/2019,76
here tonight no big deal patty Marlowe,3/25/2019,76
now I think he's I don't know what,3/25/2019,76
number he is yeah he's doing something,3/25/2019,76
good so anyway he's moving up the list,3/25/2019,76
and you know I think those guys playoff,3/25/2019,76
time for guys like patios like the,3/25/2019,76
Fountain of Youth and so he'll just get,3/25/2019,76
better and more energized as we go it,3/25/2019,76
gets shorter lots of these guys were not,3/25/2019,76
very good in the regular season,3/25/2019,76
sometimes but third times coming,3/25/2019,76
what do you like about Matthews who,3/25/2019,76
handled the matter,3/25/2019,76
we were above the puck they were really,3/25/2019,76
good like really good outstanding dialed,3/25/2019,76
in right from the start finish and all,3/25/2019,76
three of them I thought Muzzin Xion and,3/25/2019,76
those three did an unreal job for me by,3/25/2019,76
far that's the most positive sign we've,3/25/2019,76
had a long time because that gives you a,3/25/2019,76
chance no one that John or him can play,3/25/2019,76
against anybody changed it's what we did,3/25/2019,76
on purpose we knew we're gonna do this a,3/25/2019,76
couple times down the stretch and we,3/25/2019,76
just told them this morning this was,3/25/2019,76
their job and to look after it was nice,3/25/2019,76
it worked out that way,3/25/2019,76
a little pucker your neck so we gotta,3/25/2019,76
help Freddie help pretty good help,3/25/2019,76
himself we're gonna him,3/25/2019,76
pendulum move back and forth tonight,3/27/2019,77
Mike with what you like maybe what you,3/27/2019,77
didn't like well that we really started,3/27/2019,77
I've played a real good first period and,3/27/2019,77
then whatever happened in between the,3/27/2019,77
first and second they decided to really,3/27/2019,77
dig in and we got careless with the puck,3/27/2019,77
got a lot of turnovers in the second,3/27/2019,77
period we got back in the game and you,3/27/2019,77
know there were a team with a ton of,3/27/2019,77
offensive skill you know that before he,3/27/2019,77
come in here yeah if you want to get,3/27/2019,77
into a running gun game it's gonna be,3/27/2019,77
like it was we still have lots,3/27/2019,77
opportunity to win the game in the end,3/27/2019,77
we didn't win the game I really liked,3/27/2019,77
her start I was disappointed because we,3/27/2019,77
I think we've really worked hard to get,3/27/2019,77
her game back here of late it's,3/27/2019,77
disappointing our second period I,3/27/2019,77
thought with herself down with that,3/27/2019,77
there's no reason to be careless with,3/27/2019,77
the puck and not take care of it it's,3/27/2019,77
just no reason especially for a team,3/27/2019,77
that's trying to do what we're trying to,3/27/2019,77
do and so that part disappointed me Bob,3/27/2019,77
but like I said yeah they've got good,3/27/2019,77
old fence of players that make it hard,3/27/2019,77
on you and so if you get in a running,3/27/2019,77
gun game and the young D they're active,3/27/2019,77
in the back end they may get hurt why,3/27/2019,77
just thought the other night one and,3/27/2019,77
Maddy played head-to-head who do we just,3/27/2019,77
play yeah I thought they did a real good,3/27/2019,77
job being above them tonight was more,3/27/2019,77
running gun and just trading chances so,3/27/2019,77
obviously I like the other approach much,3/27/2019,77
better because I think he end up on the,3/27/2019,77
plus side the end of scorn and went in,3/27/2019,77
that way this probably was more,3/27/2019,77
entertaining for the fence well we had,3/27/2019,77
to because what we did is we gave them,3/27/2019,77
life right so we had to battle our way,3/27/2019,77
back there's no question about that,3/27/2019,77
I didn't mind our first I didn't minor,3/27/2019,77
third the second got us in trouble and,3/27/2019,77
you don't want a team that is in the,3/27/2019,77
position there and if you come out and,3/27/2019,77
you just do it right and you give them,3/27/2019,77
no life you make it hard on them but we,3/27/2019,77
gave him some life there in the second,3/27/2019,77
period why is that you know what's,3/27/2019,77
important for us to get Freddie at his,3/27/2019,77
highest level I thought in the second,3/27/2019,77
period,3/27/2019,77
we gave up Grady opportunities I've been,3/27/2019,77
through a mall on video,3/27/2019,77
but we Grady opportunities and I thought,3/27/2019,77
he was really good and give us an,3/27/2019,77
opportunity so the you know that's good,3/27/2019,77
for him he also give us an opportunity,3/27/2019,77
in the shootout wouldn't score any goals,3/27/2019,77
you know brownies one on one right away,3/27/2019,77
at the start of the game without Enzo,3/27/2019,77
came in and gave us a real good game so,3/27/2019,77
those are positive things for anybody,3/27/2019,77
does this court in a while when you,3/27/2019,77
score it's like adrenaline going through,3/27/2019,77
your bones I think that's a positive,3/27/2019,77
thing so need a few more guys before,3/27/2019,77
we're done here,3/27/2019,77
how do you wrap it all up Mike three,3/30/2019,78
periods of playing a game obviously that,3/30/2019,78
your squad could have won,3/30/2019,78
well obviously did lots of things really,3/30/2019,78
well puck ended up on our net and I,3/30/2019,78
thought we stuck with it pretty good,3/30/2019,78
thought we dug our way out and in the,3/30/2019,78
end though we didn't win then so you,3/30/2019,78
know I think there's lots of positive,3/30/2019,78
you can take from the game but it's,3/30/2019,78
unfortunate we didn't get a do well I,3/30/2019,78
thought he had a real good first period,3/30/2019,78
to move the puck you know look like a,3/30/2019,78
good player and think he down the,3/30/2019,78
stretch was as good just defensively in,3/30/2019,78
his own zone but that's one of the,3/30/2019,78
reasons you get back early and you get,3/30/2019,78
playing so you can be up to speed well,3/30/2019,78
we had lots of obviously looks we had,3/30/2019,78
lots of opportunity we did lots of good,3/30/2019,78
things and in the end we didn't finish,3/30/2019,78
around their net enough I thought,3/30/2019,78
Anderson had a real good night I mean we,3/30/2019,78
had a great look on the two-on-one there,3/30/2019,78
we had some post not but I thought with,3/30/2019,78
the opportunity how do we we need to,3/30/2019,78
finish more obviously to win tonight but,3/30/2019,78
your expectations won in the long island,3/30/2019,78
should be fun,3/30/2019,78
you know we look forward to the game,3/30/2019,78
we'll get an off day tomorrow and we got,3/30/2019,78
back-to-back out for that we got a,3/30/2019,78
bounce-back from this just because of,3/30/2019,78
the fact that we thought we did lots of,3/30/2019,78
good things as a team and they weren't,3/30/2019,78
rewarded but just keep doing good things,3/30/2019,78
good things will happen,3/30/2019,78
we want to win every night we're selfish,3/30/2019,78
that we want to win for one another I,3/30/2019,78
want to win for our fans want to win for,3/30/2019,78
ourselves so this will be no different,3/30/2019,78
you do good things good things will,3/30/2019,78
happen get prepared and let's work,3/30/2019,78
my key establish goals when the season,4/1/2019,79
begins obviously this is where you want,4/1/2019,79
to be just measure the satisfaction of,4/1/2019,79
getting it done and a building like this,4/1/2019,79
on the road well I mean obviously just,4/1/2019,79
the first thing is making the playoffs,4/1/2019,79
so we've made the playoffs three years,4/1/2019,79
in a row and there's always expectations,4/1/2019,79
the reality it's hard to make the,4/1/2019,79
playoffs in the National Hockey League,4/1/2019,79
and and I don't know when the last time,4/1/2019,79
the Leafs they're three years in a row,4/1/2019,79
but we've just done it got a good group,4/1/2019,79
we're getting better I think what we've,4/1/2019,79
been through this last little bit you,4/1/2019,79
know even though we've been playing,4/1/2019,79
better and better defensively haven't,4/1/2019,79
been winning every night I think it's,4/1/2019,79
probably good for our group I think our,4/1/2019,79
group work real hard tonight it was nice,4/1/2019,79
for John Tavares for us to come back in,4/1/2019,79
here for him to get the game-winner for,4/1/2019,79
just the way our club played in the win,4/1/2019,79
here tonight and clinch a spot and now,4/1/2019,79
we got to regroup and get ready for a,4/1/2019,79
more 15 years well I just think uh you,4/1/2019,79
know the whole game I we're prepared and,4/1/2019,79
competed hard right from the get-go and,4/1/2019,79
then you know we can get the first one,4/1/2019,79
and get the second one it is an,4/1/2019,79
opportunity we took penalties tonight,4/1/2019,79
for whatever reason that early no but,4/1/2019,79
you know you never know if they're gonna,4/1/2019,79
get a power play or something so one,4/1/2019,79
more cushion and then if we needed yes I,4/1/2019,79
think it's been good you know it's he's,4/1/2019,79
no different in the rest of us he's a,4/1/2019,79
human being,4/1/2019,79
and it doesn't go great all the time and,4/1/2019,79
then sometimes you get off kilter and,4/1/2019,79
get your own way for a bit we thought,4/1/2019,79
he's been coming back and battling hard,4/1/2019,79
and working and we need Freddy to be,4/1/2019,79
great because he's a leader for us and,4/1/2019,79
when he feels good about himself we feel,4/1/2019,79
good about our team it's important that,4/1/2019,79
he plays well I thought it was an,4/1/2019,79
important game for him but also for us,4/1/2019,79
to me I like Rosen you know we didn't,4/1/2019,79
give him a lot of minutes in the D zone,4/1/2019,79
we can really skate and pass the puck we,4/1/2019,79
obviously gonna figure out what our D is,4/1/2019,79
gonna be just start to play us over this,4/1/2019,79
next little while these are important,4/1/2019,79
games for all the D you know we're not,4/1/2019,79
in that area to see who want who's gonna,4/1/2019,79
play,4/1/2019,79
I get Boston in about ten days one it's,4/1/2019,79
great you know were excited to have that,4/1/2019,79
opportunity we're excited to be in the,4/1/2019,79
playoffs and obviously in our division,4/1/2019,79
on our side there's real good teams and,4/1/2019,79
and well that's what it's supposed to be,4/1/2019,79
like you're supposed to play a real good,4/1/2019,79
team I got two kids I live in Boston,4/1/2019,79
I'll be perfect well you know the folks,4/1/2019,79
that we'd like to just continue to get,4/1/2019,79
better and play well without the puck,4/1/2019,79
and better we do obviously that you want,4/1/2019,79
anyone feeling good you want your,4/1/2019,79
special teams done a good job I thought,4/1/2019,79
her penalty kill is outstanding tonight,4/1/2019,79
unfortunately gave up one we got,4/1/2019,79
exhausted there but you know just get,4/1/2019,79
everyone feeling good and get healthy I,4/1/2019,79
mean can we get Gardiner back oh I don't,4/1/2019,79
know for sure but I'm sure hopefully,4/1/2019,79
when you see Boston without any real,4/2/2019,80
Columbus and your team comes up with an,4/2/2019,80
effort like that tonight how does that,4/2/2019,80
make you feel I don't know what I would,4/2/2019,80
city is I thought we played last night,4/2/2019,80
and clinched a playoff spot they,4/2/2019,80
clinched a playoff spot a while ago why,4/2/2019,80
that was emotional night for our team I,4/2/2019,80
actually didn't think we're very good in,4/2/2019,80
the first period I thought would really,4/2/2019,80
bow back and made it a game,4/2/2019,80
I thought Mrazek was excellent that's my,4/2/2019,80
answer,4/2/2019,80
what's up Gary,4/2/2019,80
well obviously you know anytime you get,4/2/2019,80
an opportunity you want a chance to win,4/2/2019,80
you know and that didn't happen for him,4/2/2019,80
we didn't give them the help they didn't,4/2/2019,80
have a ton chances we did a good job,4/2/2019,80
around her net early but they had his,4/2/2019,80
own time I thought we got it settled out,4/2/2019,80
and going pretty good in the end,4/2/2019,80
you know Mrazek did a good job for them,4/2/2019,80
that's the first thing we do is take an,4/2/2019,80
off day tomorrow and I think you know,4/2/2019,80
the the level of emotional engagement of,4/2/2019,80
the two teams at the start I expressed,4/2/2019,80
already were the fact that they were one,4/2/2019,80
point ahead of Montreal and we'd,4/2/2019,80
clinched last night and there was a,4/2/2019,80
different level of emotional engagement,4/2/2019,80
I don't think that's a big surprise for,4/2/2019,80
anybody's human being the second thing I,4/2/2019,80
would say dia is we'll take the off day,4/2/2019,80
tomorrow and we'll get re-energized like,4/2/2019,80
you do after a back-to-back and now get,4/2/2019,80
we'll get ready to play a good tappity,4/2/2019,80
well we weren't going so weren't going,4/2/2019,80
or trying to get going and you know I,4/2/2019,80
thought we really did get corn I mean,4/2/2019,80
there's no question we had a real good,4/2/2019,80
push you're right,4/2/2019,80
yeah I mean in the end we gave up too,4/2/2019,80
many goals today I haven't looked at,4/2/2019,80
them all no honest with you so we'll,4/2/2019,80
look at our defense and see what we,4/2/2019,80
could have done better you know we got,4/2/2019,80
to figure out what's gonna go on in the,4/2/2019,80
back end over the next few days and I,4/2/2019,80
guess that could add to you what you're,4/2/2019,80
doing without based on guys health and,4/2/2019,80
who's available and who's not,4/2/2019,80
they were both sick and so you know I,4/2/2019,80
mean if it was we just didn't want to,4/2/2019,80
get them worse I don't know if that,4/2/2019,80
makes any sense so that's what was,4/2/2019,80
different about it then maybe normal,4/2/2019,80
you know what he's been skating regular,4/2/2019,80
here I don't know if they're clearing,4/2/2019,80
them for the next game or not I won't,4/2/2019,80
know that till after the morning skate,4/2/2019,80
and then we'll make that we might win my,4/2/2019,80
dress 7d if that's the case just to make,4/2/2019,80
sure he's looked after,4/2/2019,80
well not tonight obviously the other,4/2/2019,80
night his first game no it was,4/2/2019,80
back-to-back we weren't planning on,4/2/2019,80
playing him necessarily back-to-back but,4/2/2019,80
we chose to do that here tonight I,4/2/2019,80
thought he had a good night last night,4/2/2019,80
not quite as good tonight,4/2/2019,80
boy they're smart guys too they knew the,4/2/2019,80
emotional engagement wasn't at the level,4/2/2019,80
that needed to be to play a good team,4/2/2019,80
and they're a good team and they're a,4/2/2019,80
hungry team and we knew it was gonna be,4/2/2019,80
a tight game we didn't ask you good,4/2/2019,80
enough in the first spirits we talked,4/2/2019,80
about it and then I thought things got,4/2/2019,80
substantially better for us,4/2/2019,80
feeling pretty good about your club Mike,4/4/2019,81
despite result how they played here tied,4/4/2019,81
against a really good team yeah that was,4/4/2019,81
a good game tell you the truth you know,4/4/2019,81
you know at this point we turn the,4/4/2019,81
over there was left I thought we had a,4/4/2019,81
good game that shift we had turned it,4/4/2019,81
over a couple of times already and in,4/4/2019,81
the end we paid for you know we had some,4/4/2019,81
good chances ourselves in the third,4/4/2019,81
period I think either team gave up more,4/4/2019,81
very much I thought it was a good,4/4/2019,81
defensive game and I thought it was a,4/4/2019,81
high-level game to be honest with you,4/4/2019,81
checking wise for both teams you know,4/4/2019,81
two days before the playoffs or two,4/4/2019,81
weeks meet lots of plays and create,4/4/2019,81
space and makes forwards better didn't,4/4/2019,81
give up anything so good start really,4/4/2019,81
good so he's a good hockey player makes,4/4/2019,81
good plays he plays without the puck,4/4/2019,81
really really well and so in these big,4/4/2019,81
games is always in the right spot didn't,4/4/2019,81
know what helped but also rosin you know,4/4/2019,81
if you've been watching Rosen's been,4/4/2019,81
good too and so and that gives you an,4/4/2019,81
option you didn't know you know you,4/4/2019,81
never know when the guy comes you see,4/4/2019,81
him skate you see his points you think,4/4/2019,81
you're hoping that he's gonna be good,4/4/2019,81
I've liked him and I think as he gets,4/4/2019,81
comfortable he'll he'll use his legs,4/4/2019,81
more these real good skaters probably,4/4/2019,81
his gaps aren't quite what they're gonna,4/4/2019,81
be as he gets more comfortable so I've,4/4/2019,81
been impressed with him his ability on,4/4/2019,81
the offense of blue line and his ability,4/4/2019,81
to move the puck he's been good and he,4/4/2019,81
hasn't been a liability offensively,4/4/2019,81
three pairs now as opposed to me,4/4/2019,81
well that's what you're hoping for right,4/4/2019,81
you know and so we'll just we got,4/4/2019,81
another game here in this Montreal and,4/4/2019,81
you know so we'll find out more and then,4/4/2019,81
get ready and you know you always need,4/4/2019,81
extra bodies at playoff time that's just,4/4/2019,81
the way it is,4/4/2019,81
I won't have a full lineup just,4/4/2019,81
precautionary won't have those guys,4/4/2019,81
we're not playing either one of them,4/4/2019,81
both of those guys are planned so no,4/4/2019,81
needs to write big stories about it or,4/4/2019,81
anything like that you know one sick,4/4/2019,81
one's got I don't know what you see a,4/4/2019,81
boo-boo you know they're fine,4/4/2019,81
it was obviously a real good skater and,4/4/2019,81
what I liked about him and I was just as,4/4/2019,81
skating seems to get a shot through so I,4/4/2019,81
mean he's a good hockey player it,4/4/2019,81
appears now obviously let's watch,4/4/2019,81
like another 100 point season you're in,4/6/2019,82
the postseason good to get all this now,4/6/2019,82
out of the way build on what you've done,4/6/2019,82
and look forward well obviously it's,4/6/2019,82
nice to get a hundred points just never,4/6/2019,82
just told me that it's in the fifth time,4/6/2019,82
in franchise history so we've done it,4/6/2019,82
two years in a row which is nice being,4/6/2019,82
in the playoffs is obviously what you,4/6/2019,82
set out to start a year and you want to,4/6/2019,82
do and I thought it was a good night for,4/6/2019,82
you know more ziens Gordon forever Cappy,4/6/2019,82
Willie guys like that it was important,4/6/2019,82
to get guys feeling good and in the end,4/6/2019,82
Saturday night Hockey Montreal Toronto,4/6/2019,82
we're probably really entertaining I,4/6/2019,82
think each team had 50 shots or,4/6/2019,82
something whatever yeah 100% you know,4/6/2019,82
just by watching our team play you know,4/6/2019,82
they've already been doing that and so,4/6/2019,82
it's time to move on to something that,4/6/2019,82
we all deems real important you know we,4/6/2019,82
haven't had as much to play for here,4/6/2019,82
this last a little bit and it's been,4/6/2019,82
evident in our play and so now,4/6/2019,82
to the next level and play good Boston,4/6/2019,82
team will be ready well I mean obviously,4/6/2019,82
huge I mean our young players are are,4/6/2019,82
getting better little dearest kid so I,4/6/2019,82
was looking at the line and put little,4/6/2019,82
whole ton of 22 year old forts and it,4/6/2019,82
takes time you know and so obviously,4/6/2019,82
he's an important guy for us and you,4/6/2019,82
know they're an important line he's,4/6/2019,82
gonna play well yep,4/6/2019,82
everyone's there was no I mean they,4/6/2019,82
could all play probably much will be,4/6/2019,82
available like 25 well I felt so bad,4/6/2019,82
honest to God when we challenged the,4/6/2019,82
goal I said to the guys can you imagine,4/6/2019,82
if you challenged the goal and he,4/6/2019,82

## Using GameScore to evaluate trends
GameScore is a metric created by Dom Luszczyszyn that is a single game productivity metric used to evaluate players. While it's often used to say 'Player X has a good/bad game' - we can aggregate the team results and look at trends over the course of the season for some more high level results. The chart below just does this - we see quite a roller coaster for Leafs fans, some impressive results for Tampa during the course of the year, and some depressing outcomes for the Detroit Red Wings.

##Game 1 - Lightning Fails to Strike in the 3rd
Game 1 of the Stanley Cup went down on Saturday night - what we'll likely look back on as a historic moment as the first without fans in the building. Chances were relatively even until the 3rd period, when the Lightning made their big push to narrow the 2 goal deficit, but Khudobin stood tall and frustrated the Lightning offense. Tensions did flair up at times, which will alleviate fears that this championship would feature less passion and physicality than usual.

##Defense Wins Championships
It's a bit of annoying cliche at this point - but is supported by evidence - defense wins championships. When looking at the xGA/60 (Expected Goals Against Per 60 minutes) from EvolvingHockey, the finalists this year appear at #4 and #6, suggesting it is important aspect in building a contender. Other teams that made it into the late rounds feature on the list,  but I was a bit suprised that the Islanders weren't in the top 10 (they come in at #16)

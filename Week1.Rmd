## A Good Day to Ken Wisenhunt vs. Dale Drangus
Wisenhunt: 149
Drangus: 123
There was some sneaky rage bubbling up from me Sunday afternoon - how many times can you watch a Bill's receiver literally walk through the Jets, who seemed to have no interest in playing defense, before you start throwing things? Anyway, it benefited Josh Allen who put up 28 points against the Jets. Then captain Kirk decides to start playing in the 4th quarter, after my trash Defense gives up 43 to old-ass Aaron Rodgers. I do not like that. I wrote this on Monday - can Big Ben drop a 40 burger for a comeback win? I'm not counting on it.

## Watson Your Wallet vs. Mirjam Poterbin
Watson: 131
Poterbin:118
This was a nailbiter going into Monday night until James Conner got a limp dick and was carted off (he'll be reevaluated today). Limp tummy, Devin Fisher, prevails with solid production from his QB and OP slots via Kyler Murray and Matt Ryan. Cam Newton had a strong Pats debut, helping him fend off the racist Boston fans who stand waiting for his first slip up (Mark Wahlberg). Surprise autodraft A.J. Brown put up a measly 6 points.

## Sawuan Broccoli vs. DJ Play My Favorite Song
Broc:136
DJ: 119
Who needs running backs this year? It's not one of the deepest years at wideout with a steep dropoff in RB talent...Right? I'm pretty sure this was Zach B on draft day, and 11 points out of the RB hole won't often get it done. Still 120 points isn't bad, but just not enough to take out Broccoli man with big games from Hopkins and Andrews.

## Scorekeeper Jeff vs. Sa' Quads
Jeff:152
Quads:102
chew? Scorekeeper Jeff puts up a 152 points - a minor victory in his recovery from his failing marriage and alcholism. We can all channel our inner Jeff and imagine him fist pumping repeatedly as CMC crossed the goal line for the second time. Sa'quads put up a nice 0.4 yards per carry in a tough week 1 performance, but the hurdle was pretty cool.

## Take Me Tua Title vs. Mike Mike
Tua:103
Mike Mike:163
Yikes. Akron gets aboslutely roasted by a Mike Mike team that is coming in hot to the 2020 season. Rodgers, Jacons, Thielen, and Ridley all put up 25+ fantasy points, while Akron's top scorer was old-ass Drew Brees with 14 points. When you're sub 100 points, I feel like you usually have a 0 point guy who got hurt or just pissed his ass the whole game, but Akron's team was consistently mediocre and failed to get much upside from his top picks. Mike Mike, who continues to make team identification most easy, takes this one.

## Sutton Aint Right vs. Fantasy Football Team
Aint right:97
Dumb name: 110
Really wanted Ehlinger to win this one because Fantasy Football Team is such a shit team name, but Paluch takes the W in a pretty low scoring affair. Baker Mayfield still looks like a stale diap but Baltimore was a tough matchup. Kamara and Mahomes were the top scorers in the matchup, and the only ones with 20+.

## Eliminator Challenge: RIP ScoreKeeper Jeff
![Nice](https://github.com/hockeyfan22/swagleague/raw/master/jeff.jpg)
Mr. ScoreKeeper "Chew" Jeff, son of the late Clockrunner Jeff, was born June 9, 2008 in Jackson, Wyoming. He attended public schools in Jackson, and was well known as a fan of the local basketball team. While he failed to reach the position of official scorekeeper, he always yelled the score from his seat in the bleacher, often incorrectly, to the laughter of others in the stands. In his later life, his focus turned to Fantasy Football, what he called the "swag league", and his devotion shifted away from his friends and family and to the waiver wire. Jeff had a solid 3 weeks of performance before falling to the eliminator challenge. RIP.

Previous Eliminator Victims: AE | ZB | MG

## Dale Drangus vs. Straight Outta Hopkin
Drangus 137 | Hopkin 112

I'm sure that was the first time a non QB in the OP slot threw for a TD, and it was definitely the first time the receiver was on the opposing roster. Seriously, I'm all for benching Mayfield for Landry if we get more dumbass looking throws like that.

## DJ Play My Favorite Song vs. BJs Chubby Hubby
DJ 121 | Chubby 108

Dev's tummy takes its second straight loss, and I lose out on my best content without being able to make fun of Zach's RB... but Kenyan Drake looks like turd! Devin's chub goes down on a team that is starting to look a little one dimensional. Zach gets his first W off of strong perofrmance from Jackson, Minshew, and Gibson (and that's literally it).

## A Good Day to Ken Whisenhunt vs. Mirjam Poterbin
Whisenhunt 149 | Mirjam 103

Limp dick performance by Wonki whose team takes a COVID hit with Cam Newton being out, and the Ten/Pit game being moved. Wonki's dogshit team will eagerly await a potential season cancellation so that he can get his fantasy buy in money back (jk, he hasn't paid). Whisenhunt is rolling - big games from Allen, Cook, and Gordon.

## Scorekeeper Jeff vs. Fantasy Football Team
Jeff 100 | FFT 141

Jeff is really struggling - he has passed his strawberry chew phase and is pumping the chew stuff directly into his veins through an IV. He has resorted to proposing and canceling trades with famous dumbass BJ Chub. FFT puts up a high score with a well balanced performance - all positional spots were above 14.5.

## Tomlin's Fist Pump Supply vs. Mike Mike
Tomlin 141 | Mike 124

Tomlin's fist is on a 3 game win streak, taking out Mike Mike who made some tough lineup decisions. Putting up 124 is still pretty good considering he basically didn't play any WRs this week. Kamara looks like the RB1 so far this year, good game from him and Amari Cooper for Ehlinger to put up over 140 points.

## Judge Jeudy vs. Put It In Reverse Terry
Jeudy 127 | Terry 129

A close matchup amongst the Krons - a big game from Kittle puts Zach across the finish line despite a huge breakout from Joe Mixon. Unfortunate injury to Ekeler doesn't help Akron who takes his second consecutive loss.

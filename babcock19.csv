well I mean an unbelievable honor to be,10/2/2019,1,343
the captain Elise I'm Darrell and,10/2/2019,1,343
Wendell were in there after or you know,10/2/2019,1,343
I don't care who you are it's pretty,10/2/2019,1,343
special to say the least and but he's,10/2/2019,1,343
the kind of man and he's kind of leader,10/2/2019,1,343
and he's kind of person that our guys,10/2/2019,1,343
look up to and he does everything right,10/2/2019,1,343
every day he's all about winning he's,10/2/2019,1,343
not about Johnny's about winning he's a,10/2/2019,1,343
great example to all of us you know when,10/2/2019,1,343
I asked him a question he doesn't think,10/2/2019,1,343
is this good for John he thinks is this,10/2/2019,1,343
good for the team he's a man so I think,10/2/2019,1,343
it's great I think it's great for Mitch,10/2/2019,1,343
and Matty to is as they grow in their,10/2/2019,1,343
leadership roles obviously Morgan,10/2/2019,1,343
Riley's a huge leader here and and sets,10/2/2019,1,343
the tone with enthusiasm and work ethic,10/2/2019,1,343
as well and so we're lucky,10/2/2019,1,343
you know Hyman and Muzzin are big-time,10/2/2019,1,343
leaders on this team too in their honor,10/2/2019,1,343
leadership group and we ideally will add,10/2/2019,1,343
more and more to lot because it's,10/2/2019,1,343
important to have lots of guys all in if,10/2/2019,1,343
you're gonna have success it's not the,10/2/2019,1,343
manager or the coach or the presidents,10/2/2019,1,343
not the leader and the players take,10/2/2019,1,343
control the team and they set the,10/2/2019,1,343
accountability and that's how you win in,10/2/2019,1,343
the end so it took us a while to get to,10/2/2019,1,343
this point but we're excited we're at,10/2/2019,1,343
this point,10/2/2019,1,343
well there's no question about it is is,10/2/2019,1,343
I know we all were in a hurry you want,10/2/2019,1,343
everybody instant gratification that's,10/2/2019,1,343
society day and it's obviously Toronto,10/2/2019,1,343
and hockey but the reality is is you,10/2/2019,1,343
just keep plugging away and doing good,10/2/2019,1,343
things and good things happen and we're,10/2/2019,1,343
still gonna have lots of moments this,10/2/2019,1,343
year you wonder what the heck's going on,10/2/2019,1,343
but just keep grinding and doing good,10/2/2019,1,343
things and and that's makes you better,10/2/2019,1,343
well I thought it was a perfect start,10/2/2019,1,343
for them you know you come out we're,10/2/2019,1,343
nervous - banging internet then we got,10/2/2019,1,343
three power plays in a row and we're,10/2/2019,1,343
borderline dysfunctional just tense they,10/2/2019,1,343
couldn't move we didn't skate good but I,10/2/2019,1,343
thought once we got through that down,10/2/2019,1,343
one nothing and we came out and I,10/2/2019,1,343
thought we played and we thought we,10/2/2019,1,343
played pretty good an exhibition at the,10/2/2019,1,343
end not at the start but at the end and,10/2/2019,1,343
I like the fact that we have the puck a,10/2/2019,1,343
lot and were spent a lot of time in the,10/2/2019,1,343
offensive zone we sure didn't get it,10/2/2019,1,343
back we seem to be working pretty hard I,10/2/2019,1,343
was real impressed with the Kerfoot line,10/2/2019,1,343
tonight Mackay off and more and those,10/2/2019,1,343
guys were good so the more depth you,10/2/2019,1,343
everyone knows Matthews was good I know,10/2/2019,1,343
that too so you know but it's those,10/2/2019,1,343
other guys that create depth that allow,10/2/2019,1,343
you to be better I think are important,10/2/2019,1,343
for us well you know is that kind of,10/2/2019,1,343
player right here's a chance to be a,10/2/2019,1,343
generational player and so now what can,10/2/2019,1,343
you learn from John you can learn John,10/2/2019,1,343
just working every day working hard,10/2/2019,1,343
winning every puck kinda hard in,10/2/2019,1,343
practice so that's the challenge for our,10/2/2019,1,343
group is is we have to get better we all,10/2/2019,1,343
understand we've laid it out very,10/2/2019,1,343
clearly where we got to get better and,10/2/2019,1,343
we evaluated herself after exhibition,10/2/2019,1,343
and will continue to do that and where,10/2/2019,1,343
we're going everybody knows that what we,10/2/2019,1,343
got to do to have success and so we talk,10/2/2019,1,343
about on a daily basis and and we're,10/2/2019,1,343
trying to work towards that doesn't mean,10/2/2019,1,343
it's always gonna go good but at least a,10/2/2019,1,343
better plan,10/2/2019,1,343
yeah he's good,10/2/2019,1,343
that's what it says but he's way better,10/2/2019,1,343
than you've seen he just gotta get,10/2/2019,1,343
comfortable and I've gotta know what,10/2/2019,1,343
direction he's going and all that stuff,10/2/2019,1,343
and when he when he understands the,10/2/2019,1,343
language better and he's don't get me,10/2/2019,1,343
wrong he's smart and he understands good,10/2/2019,1,343
but it's going so fast on the ice and,10/2/2019,1,343
you're talking to guys and it's hard for,10/2/2019,1,343
him but I thought I mean he's,10/2/2019,1,343
unbelievable patently killer hole,10/2/2019,1,343
can he fly that well you know I always,10/2/2019,1,343
hate comparing anyone to Nicolas from,10/2/2019,1,343
like seven-time Norris Trophy winner and,10/2/2019,1,343
one of the finest human beings you ever,10/2/2019,1,343
meet but John Tavares is his own person,10/2/2019,1,343
and does things there's one way and I,10/2/2019,1,343
mean he's incredible to be around,10/2/2019,1,343
because he makes you a better coach not,10/2/2019,1,343
scared to tell you things and that's shy,10/2/2019,1,343
I'm not scared to tell the guys things,10/2/2019,1,343
not I don't know if he ever suffered,10/2/2019,1,343
from peer pressure in his life but sure,10/2/2019,1,343
doesn't now does the right thing on a,10/2/2019,1,343
daily basis wants to be great wants to,10/2/2019,1,343
get better good man good family man you,10/2/2019,1,343
know pretty impressive for us to have a,10/2/2019,1,343
guy like that,10/2/2019,1,343
you know why I think it helps the other,10/2/2019,1,343
guys become what they want to be too,10/2/2019,1,343
we're all trying to get better each and,10/2/2019,1,343
every day and we're trying to become the,10/2/2019,1,343
people we want to be in it's a good,10/2/2019,1,343
example being beg was on that he just,10/2/2019,1,343
right away he was talking it was one of,10/2/2019,1,343
those ones where the linesman wasn't in,10/2/2019,1,343
the way was lots of times I play the,10/2/2019,1,343
lines means in the way in in you can't,10/2/2019,1,343
tell so obviously that's a big play in,10/2/2019,1,343
the game right there and an important,10/2/2019,1,343
play for us and those guys were on top,10/2/2019,1,343
of it and and brew and beanbag got it,10/2/2019,1,343
right and which is important we talked,10/2/2019,1,343
before they went through it obviously,10/2/2019,1,343
they don't want to be under the gun so,10/2/2019,1,343
he went through in the challenges this,10/2/2019,1,343
year you got to know you flat-out got to,10/2/2019,1,343
know it's got a there's no pretend and,10/2/2019,1,343
you know you better know so we,10/2/2019,1,343
talked about that and they were right,10/2/2019,1,343
take us back to the opening five minutes,10/4/2019,2,146
of the game tonight Mike and just what,10/4/2019,2,146
Freddy's presence meant in terms of,10/4/2019,2,146
studying things and getting you guys off,10/4/2019,2,146
on the right foot,10/4/2019,2,146
anytime you come on the road you know,10/4/2019,2,146
you're gonna have to try to weather the,10/4/2019,2,146
first ten and and do good things I,10/4/2019,2,146
thought we did a good job with that and,10/4/2019,2,146
got through that I thought we've got,10/4/2019,2,146
playing pretty good when we went ahead,10/4/2019,2,146
to nothing then we got carried away and,10/4/2019,2,146
turned the puck over number of times we,10/4/2019,2,146
gave him the one goal there and then,10/4/2019,2,146
they got some momentum but I thought we,10/4/2019,2,146
got ourselves reset in between the,10/4/2019,2,146
second and third and came out and played,10/4/2019,2,146
well I mean obviously you want it to be,10/4/2019,2,146
real dangerous we have good people on it,10/4/2019,2,146
and we have a good scheme you know I,10/4/2019,2,146
thought a little John did a great job,10/4/2019,2,146
tonight taking the goalies eyes which,10/4/2019,2,146
really helped on two goals one wasn't a,10/4/2019,2,146
power play but two two goals so you know,10/4/2019,2,146
that's a big part of it too but,10/4/2019,2,146
obviously you want to have success on,10/4/2019,2,146
your special teams,10/4/2019,2,146
curse line came out there and then spaz,10/4/2019,2,146
his line and then they get out there and,10/4/2019,2,146
their Center was out there for a minute,10/4/2019,2,146
and 30 so you know what's kind of back,10/4/2019,2,146
to back to back there which was real,10/4/2019,2,146
good job I thought it was real good you,10/4/2019,2,146
know I thought it was real happy to be,10/4/2019,2,146
doing what he's doing he was great on,10/4/2019,2,146
the bench he was great on the icings,10/4/2019,2,146
good in the room and I thought he did a,10/4/2019,2,146
good job for us so good for him you know,10/4/2019,2,146
we're gonna go right back the way we,10/4/2019,2,146
were tomorrow and give those guys,10/4/2019,2,146
another opportunity and then we'll come,10/4/2019,2,146
back again the following day basically,10/4/2019,2,146
you know we do the same with code on,10/4/2019,2,146
that other side at the start and we play,10/4/2019,2,146
him later and the penalty kill we got,10/4/2019,2,146
some real good penalty killers obviously,10/4/2019,2,146
McCabe's gonna be a real good one and,10/4/2019,2,146
then when you put in our other guys with,10/4/2019,2,146
Michie and morresy we want the motor,10/4/2019,2,146
first but we need someone to get the,10/4/2019,2,146
draw I thought I thought he did a good,10/4/2019,2,146
job now he got cut out to one two I,10/4/2019,2,146
actually put him out at the end probably,10/4/2019,2,146
screwed him of it and he was breathing,10/4/2019,2,146
on his eyelids when he got back to the,10/4/2019,2,146
bench right if he takes off he said for,10/4/2019,2,146
sure and then didn't win it and they,10/4/2019,2,146
seem'd him when he got running around a,10/4/2019,2,146
little bit but that's part of but I was,10/4/2019,2,146
impressed with him tonight and I was,10/4/2019,2,146
impressed with he was happy to do what,10/4/2019,2,146
we need them to do yeah hutch tomorrow,10/4/2019,2,146
Mike you're up for one did you see at,10/5/2019,3,207
that point maybe indications that would,10/5/2019,3,207
have led to some of the class you saw,10/5/2019,3,207
why I didn't think we skated a very good,10/5/2019,3,207
all night to be honest with you right,10/5/2019,3,207
from the start to the finish where you,10/5/2019,3,207
know what obviously we're in a good spot,10/5/2019,3,207
weren't real crisp you know I guess the,10/5/2019,3,207
way I look at it is we had three games,10/5/2019,3,207
and four nights and we knew going in she,10/5/2019,3,207
was gonna be a grind and we got 5 out of,10/5/2019,3,207
6 points so that was a huge goal guys,10/5/2019,3,207
executed real good there with Mitch,10/5/2019,3,207
going behind his back to bears there to,10/5/2019,3,207
get us the goal equalized it's,10/5/2019,3,207
disappointing cuz you're up for sure but,10/5/2019,3,207
on the other side of that is you know,10/5/2019,3,207
what's a lot of hockey right out the,10/5/2019,3,207
gate it's not like in the middle of,10/5/2019,3,207
November or something like that so I,10/5/2019,3,207
thought we look like we had no gas I,10/5/2019,3,207
thought the court lines had some other,10/5/2019,3,207
than that I didn't think we had lots of,10/5/2019,3,207
characters well I've never seen it by,10/5/2019,3,207
anybody ever so I mean you know I'm sure,10/5/2019,3,207
I'm sure he feels bad and would like to,10/5/2019,3,207
have it back yeah thing about you can't,10/5/2019,3,207
get it back and so we all got to learn,10/5/2019,3,207
from it the lessons are important to,10/5/2019,3,207
during the year and then we got one no,10/5/2019,3,207
no I'll talk to him but I'm not talking,10/5/2019,3,207
to him now he's gonna have enough people,10/5/2019,3,207
to then you'll probably get the message,10/5/2019,3,207
pretty good I imagine,10/5/2019,3,207
well actually I felt bad for us because,10/5/2019,3,207
to me yeah in the end we hung him out to,10/5/2019,3,207
dry I thought hutch had done a good,10/5/2019,3,207
enough job when we were up early head,10/5/2019,3,207
down to some real made some real good,10/5/2019,3,207
saves they were skating by us and he,10/5/2019,3,207
made some good saves and so you know,10/5/2019,3,207
it's unfortunate you come in as the,10/5/2019,3,207
backup in a big game in you're in a good,10/5/2019,3,207
spot it doesn't go the way you want you,10/5/2019,3,207
want a guy to leave the building feeling,10/5/2019,3,207
better but that's that's part of pro,10/5/2019,3,207
sports too it's not supposed to be easy,10/5/2019,3,207
so dig in and yeah you got a good day,10/5/2019,3,207
off enjoy your family get ready for next,10/5/2019,3,207
learn all three games or a lot yeah I,10/5/2019,3,207
know I like I've liked our team you know,10/5/2019,3,207
not tonight,10/5/2019,3,207
yeah but even at the end exhibition you,10/5/2019,3,207
know I'd like their team I think we got,10/5/2019,3,207
a good team I think we played pretty,10/5/2019,3,207
hard I think we can put a lot of,10/5/2019,3,207
pressure on the opposition I didn't,10/5/2019,3,207
think we did that tonight though you,10/5/2019,3,207
know I didn't think we had the same kind,10/5/2019,3,207
of juice we normally have for whatever,10/5/2019,3,207
reason and in the end it'll I'm going,10/5/2019,3,207
back to whatever yeah whatever I'm doing,10/5/2019,3,207
well Cerf is I think I said earlier Cerf,10/5/2019,3,207
is I think he's good players got some,10/5/2019,3,207
grease to him he enjoys it,10/5/2019,3,207
he's smart he's competitive you know he,10/5/2019,3,207
seems to be feeling good and,10/5/2019,3,207
understanding how to play know lots of,10/5/2019,3,207
our game tonight wasn't as organized as,10/5/2019,3,207
you'd like it to be,10/5/2019,3,207
I think chaos a really good player I,10/5/2019,3,207
don't think he you know I put him out,10/5/2019,3,207
there killing the penalty yeah they're,10/5/2019,3,207
in overtime I didn't know for sure if he,10/5/2019,3,207
can understand what I was telling them,10/5/2019,3,207
but he did it anyway and look good doing,10/5/2019,3,207
it so that's good he's getting better,10/5/2019,3,207
every day and more Z's a you know a good,10/5/2019,3,207
young kid that's working hard I thought,10/5/2019,3,207
he had a real good for check tonight to,10/5/2019,3,207
turn that puck over to Lao Cerf to score,10/5/2019,3,207
so I didn't think Morsy was as good last,10/5/2019,3,207
night but it was real good tonight do,10/5/2019,3,207
you guys have a good day,10/5/2019,3,207
you know I thought it was a good game,10/7/2019,4,146
that you know they got a real good team,10/7/2019,4,146
I think we got a good team I thought it,10/7/2019,4,146
wasn't much to pick I thought we had,10/7/2019,4,146
real good chances in the end though good,10/7/2019,4,146
teams find a way to win and so games,10/7/2019,4,146
right there on the line one in the third,10/7/2019,4,146
period,10/7/2019,4,146
and they found a way to get one and we,10/7/2019,4,146
didn't so we had good chances but didn't,10/7/2019,4,146
and they made a play they had a nice,10/7/2019,4,146
little peck there and and then once,10/7/2019,4,146
seemed we had five guys inside we should,10/7/2019,4,146
have sort of low we didn't so in the end,10/7/2019,4,146
that's what good teams do you get a,10/7/2019,4,146
swagger about you know you're gonna win,10/7/2019,4,146
you find a way to win well I'd like this,10/7/2019,4,146
every night except the been eight on the,10/7/2019,4,146
back to back they're the three and four,10/7/2019,4,146
I didn't think we were very good yeah we,10/7/2019,4,146
have a chance to get a lot better,10/7/2019,4,146
obviously I thought I liked Sandman,10/7/2019,4,146
tonight that's first time he's kinda I,10/7/2019,4,146
don't know how many minutes he played,10/7/2019,4,146
but oh I guess I gotta look yeah I,10/7/2019,4,146
thought he was impressive I didn't think,10/7/2019,4,146
you got rattled I thought he was good so,10/7/2019,4,146
that's positive you know I think Cerf,10/7/2019,4,146
roads getting better we just got to keep,10/7/2019,4,146
grinding away and keep getting better,10/7/2019,4,146
that was his best by far,10/7/2019,4,146
so he had the puck he got the puck you,10/7/2019,4,146
gotta back he he made things happen I,10/7/2019,4,146
thought it was his most competitive game,10/7/2019,4,146
this year and you know won't be one we,10/7/2019,4,146
like to see obviously in a regular basis,10/7/2019,4,146
he has all the ability he had turned,10/7/2019,4,146
backs he won puck see he was on the puck,10/7/2019,4,146
he was strong I thought he's very,10/7/2019,4,146
effective tonight,10/7/2019,4,146
yeah I know for sure you know obviously,10/7/2019,4,146
our third line was her best line two,10/7/2019,4,146
nights ago and then this line I was,10/7/2019,4,146
alright tight we'll have a look at it,10/7/2019,4,146
here tomorrow kind of see we've rotated,10/7/2019,4,146
back and forth now for four games are we,10/7/2019,4,146
gonna do it for two more now you know,10/7/2019,4,146
their National Hockey League in the best,10/7/2019,4,146
guys play,10/7/2019,4,146
I'm as good a well good you know just,10/7/2019,4,146
gotta figure it out over time because we,10/7/2019,4,146
need them to be dominant because you,10/7/2019,4,146
know and so everyone's just gotta figure,10/7/2019,4,146
it out and just keep working and,10/7/2019,4,146
grinding,10/7/2019,4,146
well tonight was this point I mean it,10/10/2019,5,172
wasn't like any of the other games we've,10/10/2019,5,172
been in obviously I mean there were,10/10/2019,5,172
seven goals in the first period,10/10/2019,5,172
I actually thought in the second we got,10/10/2019,5,172
her going but never got on the inside,10/10/2019,5,172
they scored late and then we had no,10/10/2019,5,172
answer whatsoever,10/10/2019,5,172
any way you look at it even going in the,10/10/2019,5,172
third you can still leave the building,10/10/2019,5,172
feeling good,10/10/2019,5,172
if you perform right in the third we,10/10/2019,5,172
didn't so we didn't execute a high,10/10/2019,5,172
enough level we didn't play right they,10/10/2019,5,172
were better than us they won all the,10/10/2019,5,172
fifty fifties all the loose puck battles,10/10/2019,5,172
we took three penalties in the first and,10/10/2019,5,172
I thought God had a sink you know it was,10/10/2019,5,172
a very good night for us I thought it,10/10/2019,5,172
was gonna be a hell of a game I didn't,10/10/2019,5,172
think it was,10/10/2019,5,172
well I just thought in the first period,10/10/2019,5,172
we had you know some guys got cold some,10/10/2019,5,172
guys got we just couldn't play him,10/10/2019,5,172
because we we turn the puck over two,10/10/2019,5,172
times on the penalty kill the guys that,10/10/2019,5,172
were on get an up staying out there for,10/10/2019,5,172
a minute 30 in a long time we just for,10/10/2019,5,172
whatever reason we weren't good no I,10/10/2019,5,172
think you got to give them a lot of,10/10/2019,5,172
credit they were fast they were on the,10/10/2019,5,172
puck they were tenacious they did it,10/10/2019,5,172
right and they won we I mean they,10/10/2019,5,172
stripped us from behind they won 5050,10/10/2019,5,172
battles all over the rink I thought even,10/10/2019,5,172
when we had the puck suddenly they had,10/10/2019,5,172
the puck so when the end who wasn't good,10/10/2019,5,172
enough for us that's the bottom line,10/10/2019,5,172
wasn't good enough,10/10/2019,5,172
well obviously is you know if you look,10/10/2019,5,172
at what's going on so far this year I've,10/10/2019,5,172
liked the majority of everything that's,10/10/2019,5,172
gone on I didn't like tonight so I'm you,10/10/2019,5,172
know I you don't be a coach and just be,10/10/2019,5,172
a fan and be anybody you know whether,10/10/2019,5,172
you want enough 50/50 to give yourself a,10/10/2019,5,172
chance we didn't do that tonight so in,10/10/2019,5,172
the end we we didn't look like a very,10/10/2019,5,172
good hockey club and they look quicker,10/10/2019,5,172
better more organized you could say,10/10/2019,5,172
whatever you want more skilled whatever,10/10/2019,5,172
you want we didn't give herself a chance,10/10/2019,5,172
what was the problem for me just the,10/10/2019,5,172
fact that we had Mitch take it and we,10/10/2019,5,172
didn't do what we were supposed to do,10/10/2019,5,172
you know we had you know we've seen it,10/10/2019,5,172
before I just we didn't do what we're,10/10/2019,5,172
supposed to do so anyway you look at it,10/10/2019,5,172
when you get organized that's on you as,10/10/2019,5,172
the coach we got to recognize what we,10/10/2019,5,172
talked about it but we didn't do it so,10/10/2019,5,172
that's on us well I think anytime you,10/10/2019,5,172
lose it's concern you know and that's,10/10/2019,5,172
what I said - yeah I really thought last,10/10/2019,5,172
game was her best game we lost it so in,10/10/2019,5,172
the end you're in a points business you,10/10/2019,5,172
got to get points so we got to clean,10/10/2019,5,172
this up and get back at her we play,10/10/2019,5,172
Detroit done is it Thursday Saturday,10/10/2019,5,172
like he didn't hesitate to reward your,10/12/2019,6,136
third and fourth lines with a lot of,10/12/2019,6,136
prominent ice time in this game what,10/12/2019,6,136
what appealed to you about their play,10/12/2019,6,136
here tonight well they were good I mean,10/12/2019,6,136
I started to go too short,10/12/2019,6,136
whatever line you want to call it D zone,10/12/2019,6,136
there every time and they seem to win,10/12/2019,6,136
the draw and play in the offensive zone,10/12/2019,6,136
so that was a good line for us and I,10/12/2019,6,136
mean kerfs line with Morsy and McCabe,10/12/2019,6,136
been getting better each and every game,10/12/2019,6,136
and they've been good lots of games for,10/12/2019,6,136
us so I was positive well I mean II did,10/12/2019,6,136
go to another year in the league or is,10/12/2019,6,136
he you know was a right hand face of God,10/12/2019,6,136
we didn't have that and and so they were,10/12/2019,6,136
just not in the same situation there,10/12/2019,6,136
were a year ago I thought Timo had a,10/12/2019,6,136
heck of a game I mean was fast was,10/12/2019,6,136
strong was physical,10/12/2019,6,136
you know the goulds nut stuff were bonus,10/12/2019,6,136
but I thought he played real well it's,10/12/2019,6,136
just a product of three years in the,10/12/2019,6,136
American Hockey League really helps in,10/12/2019,6,136
his maturation doesn't well obviously,10/12/2019,6,136
it's a real good leak and you know it's,10/12/2019,6,136
hard to be good in that league some guys,10/12/2019,6,136
that are good in that league don't it,10/12/2019,6,136
doesn't transfer the National Hockey,10/12/2019,6,136
League but the guys who can skate and,10/12/2019,6,136
process information and normally,10/12/2019,6,136
transfers and and you know in his case,10/12/2019,6,136
it looks like it is you know we thought,10/12/2019,6,136
our work ethic was really good in camp,10/12/2019,6,136
really good at the start like that all,10/12/2019,6,136
the way through we didn't like it last,10/12/2019,6,136
game but to me that's got to be our,10/12/2019,6,136
calling card is if we go to work or,10/12/2019,6,136
talent well show the other team I like,10/12/2019,6,136
their consistency in our patients in our,10/12/2019,6,136
game even when they scored we didn't get,10/12/2019,6,136
off truck we just played the next shift,10/12/2019,6,136
that's what we're hoping and trying to,10/12/2019,6,136
do and you know against good players,10/12/2019,6,136
Larkins line was out there we knew,10/12/2019,6,136
they're coming we just put them out,10/12/2019,6,136
there and you know you don't know what's,10/12/2019,6,136
gonna happen we're down one nothing at,10/12/2019,6,136
that point you you you don't know what's,10/12/2019,6,136
gonna happen but if the guys can do it,10/12/2019,6,136
obviously it's a huge deal for you and,10/12/2019,6,136
make sure way better hockey club and a,10/12/2019,6,136
way deeper and then you can play,10/12/2019,6,136
Johnny and Mario offensive zone all the,10/12/2019,6,136
time which is easier on them,10/12/2019,6,136
another gear first period down one well,10/15/2019,7,145
we had to obviously weren't as good as,10/15/2019,7,145
we'd like to be in the first you know I,10/15/2019,7,145
didn't think I didn't think we gave up,10/15/2019,7,145
much to be honest with you until they,10/15/2019,7,145
got on the powerplay but I still didn't,10/15/2019,7,145
think we were sharp and good as we need,10/15/2019,7,145
to be so you always want to be real good,10/15/2019,7,145
at home especially and starting on time,10/15/2019,7,145
is important so we gotta do a better job,10/15/2019,7,145
you know I just been watching it no one,10/15/2019,7,145
seemed to be going so I just tried it,10/15/2019,7,145
and seemed to be okay so just stay with,10/15/2019,7,145
it yeah the first 50 minutes let's that,10/15/2019,7,145
compared was no real good I played last,10/15/2019,7,145
night so you know I mean but in saying,10/15/2019,7,145
all that or yesterday,10/15/2019,7,145
you know it was a good 15 minutes for us,10/15/2019,7,145
we played right it was good so good for,10/15/2019,7,145
him you know who's good player and it's,10/15/2019,7,145
much better defensively and and he's,10/15/2019,7,145
always been good old ffensive LY and so,10/15/2019,7,145
you know it's important that he has good,10/15/2019,7,145
nights feels good about himself or,10/15/2019,7,145
anytime you're you're good players score,10/15/2019,7,145
and generate offense and that's what,10/15/2019,7,145
they like to do and they get feeling,10/15/2019,7,145
good your team's better well I'm you,10/15/2019,7,145
know I talked to him you know all year,10/15/2019,7,145
so if you and and you're basically,10/15/2019,7,145
talking by text more than anything else,10/15/2019,7,145
so when you talk to a guy that much or,10/15/2019,7,145
whatsapp what did we call it yeah you're,10/15/2019,7,145
bound to have some communication and and,10/15/2019,7,145
in the end,10/15/2019,7,145
Mickey's his understanding of the,10/15/2019,7,145
English language fantastic anyways a,10/15/2019,7,145
very educated guy I've said this a,10/15/2019,7,145
number of times this gal went to Boston,10/15/2019,7,145
College you know on a visitation,10/15/2019,7,145
whatever he's been around it a lot so,10/15/2019,7,145
he's way ahead of most guys will get on,10/15/2019,7,145
the plane that's good to both and decide,10/15/2019,7,145
and break down the little game and then,10/15/2019,7,145
by the time we land we'll have a plan,10/15/2019,7,145
for tomorrow you know obviously that's,10/15/2019,7,145
two nights in a row or a fourth line but,10/15/2019,7,145
they're really good for us,10/15/2019,7,145
like a great 19 minutes to open the game,10/16/2019,8,183
what are those five successful penalties,10/16/2019,8,183
do to take maybe your club out of some,10/16/2019,8,183
rhythm here on the road well obviously,10/16/2019,8,183
some guys are freezing and some guys are,10/16/2019,8,183
getting killed I thought tonight you,10/16/2019,8,183
know like you said we started good I,10/16/2019,8,183
thought we were set up good I were,10/16/2019,8,183
playing well you know we had a couple of,10/16/2019,8,183
Sordo problems that started a second,10/16/2019,8,183
period we took penalties you know we,10/16/2019,8,183
knocked the one over the glass and you,10/16/2019,8,183
know then we spend the rest of the night,10/16/2019,8,183
chasing the game I thought we tried to,10/16/2019,8,183
crawl our way back into the game i over,10/16/2019,8,183
played guys in the third I mean you're,10/16/2019,8,183
chasing the game and in the end we,10/16/2019,8,183
didn't have enough to get it done so,10/16/2019,8,183
it's disappointing because we thought we,10/16/2019,8,183
were set up pretty good but the bottom,10/16/2019,8,183
line is got to find a way to play better,10/16/2019,8,183
in his back-to-backs I haven't had a,10/16/2019,8,183
chance I need to go through the whole,10/16/2019,8,183
thing you know we'll look at it close on,10/16/2019,8,183
the flight the bottom line is we got to,10/16/2019,8,183
do a better job keeping out of our net,10/16/2019,8,183
you know a couple of the sword outs in,10/16/2019,8,183
our own d zone I mean it's one thing if,10/16/2019,8,183
they've made a play that's unbelievable,10/16/2019,8,183
but if you're not standing next to your,10/16/2019,8,183
guy that's on you I thought we had done,10/16/2019,8,183
a real good job tonight on the penalty,10/16/2019,8,183
kill to tell you the truth I finally,10/16/2019,8,183
killed was really good and we gave up,10/16/2019,8,183
the one five on three so yeah it's not,10/16/2019,8,183
good enough you got to find a way each,10/16/2019,8,183
and every night and you need different,10/16/2019,8,183
people to do it each and every night and,10/16/2019,8,183
you can't give up as many goals on the,10/16/2019,8,183
back-to-back that's 10 goals on two,10/16/2019,8,183
games back to back can't do it we're,10/16/2019,8,183
trying to get that line to go right and,10/16/2019,8,183
but yeah you know I movement guys around,10/16/2019,8,183
all the time I don't know how great that,10/16/2019,8,183
is either but I thought he had great,10/16/2019,8,183
legs and was flying that line the,10/16/2019,8,183
Kerfoot line was never getting on the,10/16/2019,8,183
ice together because those two guys were,10/16/2019,8,183
penalty killin and then I come back and,10/16/2019,8,183
I get Matthews and Ferris going on for,10/16/2019,8,183
the penalty kill so I just figured this,10/16/2019,8,183
was a better opportunity to get him more,10/16/2019,8,183
I was good at that line was great they,10/16/2019,8,183
just never got to play because the,10/16/2019,8,183
special teams but I thought Cappy skated,10/16/2019,8,183
real good obviously the penalty kill,10/16/2019,8,183
goal was important for us kind of got,10/16/2019,8,183
momentum got us rolling after that you,10/16/2019,8,183
know he's been good and you know,10/16/2019,8,183
positive for us the opportunity to get,10/16/2019,8,183
got it after a day off in Boston coming,10/16/2019,8,183
you welcome that opportunity it'll be,10/16/2019,8,183
fun for us obviously you know what's,10/16/2019,8,183
interesting is leaking doesn't matter,10/16/2019,8,183
who you play every night as you can see,10/16/2019,8,183
there's nothing to pick between the,10/16/2019,8,183
teams and night after night you're in a,10/16/2019,8,183
real grind obviously we have a history,10/16/2019,8,183
with Boston they've eliminated us from,10/16/2019,8,183
the playoffs two years in a row that'll,10/16/2019,8,183
be fun getting the day off tomorrow is,10/16/2019,8,183
important for our group too but we got,10/16/2019,8,183
to get back at her we think there's a,10/16/2019,8,183
whole nother level for our group and we,10/16/2019,8,183
got to keep getting better yeah well if,10/16/2019,8,183
you just do the math in the league you,10/16/2019,8,183
got someone who can do that you can,10/16/2019,8,183
figure out the winning percentage is 29%,10/16/2019,8,183
you know it's it's real but it's not as,10/16/2019,8,183
big as it is there it's a bigger deal at,10/16/2019,8,183
the start than it is later if that makes,10/16/2019,8,183
any sense when you get used to and you,10/16/2019,8,183
get more rhythm in your game but you,10/16/2019,8,183
know we can't worry about the schedule,10/16/2019,8,183
we got to worry about the game we're,10/16/2019,8,183
playing we got a plenary,10/16/2019,8,183
distrust the importance of starting on,10/19/2019,9,234
time how did tonight start translate,10/19/2019,9,234
into the rest of the game yeah I mean,10/19/2019,9,234
obviously we got off to a good start we,10/19/2019,9,234
struggled in a second with that only,10/19/2019,9,234
trouble I thought really got a set up,10/19/2019,9,234
flow you know give a good power play and,10/19/2019,9,234
good opportunities and so in the end,10/19/2019,9,234
that probably you know that affects us I,10/19/2019,9,234
don't know how many how many thumbs we,10/19/2019,9,234
take 1 2 3 4 how many we get I didn't,10/19/2019,9,234
know that anyway what's up for me I,10/19/2019,9,234
think he's gonna be fine any x-rays were,10/19/2019,9,234
negative novels see in the morning he,10/19/2019,9,234
might not practice tomorrow but he'll be,10/19/2019,9,234
back at her Willy spot it was just we,10/19/2019,9,234
had talked about it two days ago kind of,10/19/2019,9,234
knew what we were gonna do we were gonna,10/19/2019,9,234
play Willy with Mattie when it was in,10/19/2019,9,234
the offensive zone and it was set up,10/19/2019,9,234
that way when it was a matchup situation,10/19/2019,9,234
we're gonna play Michie and then if we,10/19/2019,9,234
want with Mattie in the ozone we want to,10/19/2019,9,234
make sure you play with kerf so we could,10/19/2019,9,234
match that up and then we're gonna match,10/19/2019,9,234
up goat in diesel so I wasn't gonna,10/19/2019,9,234
explain all that to you no wasted time,10/19/2019,9,234
right yeah we'll just we'll just try to,10/19/2019,9,234
evaluate for the next game what we're,10/19/2019,9,234
gonna do,10/19/2019,9,234
we'll look at it tomorrow and get it,10/19/2019,9,234
figured out and then go from there I,10/19/2019,9,234
mean you know when we lost Johnny were a,10/19/2019,9,234
little more short stuff so moving guys,10/19/2019,9,234
around I thought we had some guys had,10/19/2019,9,234
strong strong game Mackay off I thought,10/19/2019,9,234
I had a real good game I thought Teemo,10/19/2019,9,234
had a real good game goat was,10/19/2019,9,234
outstanding so he goes through there's,10/19/2019,9,234
lots of guys that really contributed,10/19/2019,9,234
here me,10/19/2019,9,234
games like this yeah really I mean you,10/19/2019,9,234
know we wouldn't have trusted goat in,10/19/2019,9,234
these situations before you I mean you,10/19/2019,9,234
know it's it's it's no different Haller,10/19/2019,9,234
is you you get better every year,10/19/2019,9,234
sometimes you don't get to play but,10/19/2019,9,234
you're getting better you're around,10/19/2019,9,234
anything so practice every day you're,10/19/2019,9,234
trained and you're working you're,10/19/2019,9,234
getting better and then when they make,10/19/2019,9,234
this step and they earn the confidence,10/19/2019,9,234
then they really get better and,10/19/2019,9,234
obviously goat's been important for us,10/19/2019,9,234
really important for us yeah I mean I,10/19/2019,9,234
think he's got four points or something,10/19/2019,9,234
what I like about him is he's nasty you,10/19/2019,9,234
know he hits everything that moves and,10/19/2019,9,234
he's heavy on the puck and he's on the,10/19/2019,9,234
forecheck all the time and provides,10/19/2019,9,234
speed for sure Zingo not really an,10/19/2019,9,234
attempt to have the best lineup we can,10/19/2019,9,234
and if that's them together then I do,10/19/2019,9,234
that but John Tavares pretty good player,10/19/2019,9,234
too you know in that line we get Hyman,10/19/2019,9,234
back that's pretty dominant dominant,10/19/2019,9,234
line for us so and then Maddie and,10/19/2019,9,234
Johnny and Willie have been a good line,10/19/2019,9,234
for us as well in the past so but I,10/19/2019,9,234
don't know what's gonna happen I can't,10/19/2019,9,234
predict that I just know that you go,10/19/2019,9,234
day-to-day you get to write about it,10/19/2019,9,234
after I got a decide gern you know it's,10/19/2019,9,234
not as easy to second-guess gern you got,10/19/2019,9,234
to make those decisions and advance and,10/19/2019,9,234
so sometimes it goes good and you feel,10/19/2019,9,234
great and sometimes it goes terrible and,10/19/2019,9,234
you wish you wouldn't have done it but,10/19/2019,9,234
what I would say to you is this is it,10/19/2019,9,234
was it was more important for our team,10/19/2019,9,234
than their team yeah it was important,10/19/2019,9,234
because John was out to to its final way,10/19/2019,9,234
to win it and it was probably even more,10/19/2019,9,234
important when we lost Little John that,10/19/2019,9,234
we got it done I thought Freddie you,10/19/2019,9,234
know had a real good looks like he's,10/19/2019,9,234
back that's important part for us as,10/19/2019,9,234
well and I thought he had an,10/19/2019,9,234
unbelievable night for us,10/19/2019,9,234
challenging start for your hockey yeah I,10/21/2019,10,126
mean obviously we lost two battles that,10/21/2019,10,126
are right at the start of the game and,10/21/2019,10,126
they scored two goals right away I,10/21/2019,10,126
thought we could really got our game,10/21/2019,10,126
going I thought we're playing good but I,10/21/2019,10,126
mean tonight we were in the box and,10/21/2019,10,126
there's a fire I think if you count one,10/21/2019,10,126
in overtime that's six times the,10/21/2019,10,126
penalties are hooking and slash I don't,10/21/2019,10,126
need to know what they're here,10/21/2019,10,126
I got no let me they look right here,10/21/2019,10,126
what are they,10/21/2019,10,126
slashing tripping hooking tripping,10/21/2019,10,126
tripping I didn't it was hooking he,10/21/2019,10,126
added it his stick on the guy so when,10/21/2019,10,126
you put your stick on the guy's hands,10/21/2019,10,126
you go to the box so when you go to the,10/21/2019,10,126
box down many times so if you remember,10/21/2019,10,126
the game last the previous game I went,10/21/2019,10,126
to a box too many times you run early,10/21/2019,10,126
keeping before one tool box too many,10/21/2019,10,126
times so after a while it's nobody else,10/21/2019,10,126
sits on it and get on with it just put,10/21/2019,10,126
your stick on people put stick on puck,10/21/2019,10,126
not stick on hands so let's have a quick,10/21/2019,10,126
look tripping tripping interference late,10/21/2019,10,126
game slash and that's two games ago,10/21/2019,10,126
holding tripping hooking that's on us,10/21/2019,10,126
wants to see more in that area where you,10/21/2019,10,126
know yeah I agree with them a issues for,10/21/2019,10,126
us I mean just shift length discipline,10/21/2019,10,126
and shift length and then sort of though,10/21/2019,10,126
defensively but you know we do lots of,10/21/2019,10,126
good things we the ability to maintain,10/21/2019,10,126
it and do it for 60 hasn't been,10/21/2019,10,126
something that we've done game in game,10/21/2019,10,126
out and that's what good teams do and,10/21/2019,10,126
you got a more mature and grow up as a,10/21/2019,10,126
group for that to happen you just have,10/21/2019,10,126
to the level of focus that you bring to,10/21/2019,10,126
your job each day no matter what you job,10/21/2019,10,126
you do has to be at a high end,10/21/2019,10,126
problems and that third-period trouble,10/22/2019,11,157
breaking out of your own zone and then,10/22/2019,11,157
maintaining on fence well actually,10/22/2019,11,157
thought we started real good in the,10/22/2019,11,157
third there we hit the post or the,10/22/2019,11,157
crossbar that was started good in the,10/22/2019,11,157
third you know was that one of those,10/22/2019,11,157
games it was a grind the whole thing,10/22/2019,11,157
wasn't much room for the team,10/22/2019,11,157
I thought we hung in there great you,10/22/2019,11,157
know in the back to back that's what you,10/22/2019,11,157
want to do I thought we were set up,10/22/2019,11,157
perfect when in the third Mickey rung,10/22/2019,11,157
went off the bar there and I thought,10/22/2019,11,157
were going good once they got theirs I,10/22/2019,11,157
didn't think we had anything after that,10/22/2019,11,157
even though we had a power play there,10/22/2019,11,157
late we didn't get anything done on that,10/22/2019,11,157
power play you know so that part's,10/22/2019,11,157
disappointed I liked our effort I liked,10/22/2019,11,157
our operation I liked the plan the guys,10/22/2019,11,157
had no way we went about it and in the,10/22/2019,11,157
end the game was right there and the,10/22/2019,11,157
third period what you want you know in,10/22/2019,11,157
the balance and we weren't unable to get,10/22/2019,11,157
it done you know I mean they're playing,10/22/2019,11,157
against a good line so which parts the,10/22/2019,11,157
good line and which parts them you know,10/22/2019,11,157
we've talked about this a number of,10/22/2019,11,157
times over the years who should play,10/22/2019,11,157
with who and but in the end is your,10/22/2019,11,157
dominant players got to be dominant,10/22/2019,11,157
players for,10/22/2019,11,157
what yeah I thought that was that the,10/22/2019,11,157
goat line was pretty good I thought,10/22/2019,11,157
capita might have been our best forward,10/22/2019,11,157
to be honest with you so I thought that,10/22/2019,11,157
was good I thought peed out a good game,10/22/2019,11,157
for himself - and no sure's him those,10/22/2019,11,157
guys did what they're supposed to do,10/22/2019,11,157
they're supposed to keep it close and,10/22/2019,11,157
you know be good defensively and give,10/22/2019,11,157
your players that generate the offensive,10/22/2019,11,157
chance to win the game for well I think,10/22/2019,11,157
I think down on themselves what do you,10/22/2019,11,157
mean by that,10/22/2019,11,157
like after well I think last last night,10/22/2019,11,157
we should have been I don't think,10/22/2019,11,157
tonight we should be you know so last,10/22/2019,11,157
night probably deservedly so and then,10/22/2019,11,157
tonight I thought we had a better effort,10/22/2019,11,157
I don't think it maybe it was the most,10/22/2019,11,157
beautiful hockey game to watch but on,10/22/2019,11,157
this back-to-back playing a good team I,10/22/2019,11,157
thought it was set up perfect to grind,10/22/2019,11,157
fest for us give ourselves a chance so,10/22/2019,11,157
you know I think there probably weren't,10/22/2019,11,157
wrong last night I think tonight they're,10/22/2019,11,157
they're wrong it's just keep grinding,10/22/2019,11,157
and keep fine always well I just thought,10/22/2019,11,157
that you know we needed to get another,10/22/2019,11,157
one for him obviously you know what's,10/22/2019,11,157
unfortunate you know that we haven't,10/22/2019,11,157
been able to help him get a win and you,10/22/2019,11,157
know he's been in a situation with these,10/22/2019,11,157
back-to-back so obviously I haven't give,10/22/2019,11,157
him a a real good opportunity but you,10/22/2019,11,157
know tonight I thought he made some,10/22/2019,11,157
sales for us,10/22/2019,11,157
yeah I mean I thought we had a I mean,10/25/2019,12,122
her first five minutes was unreal we,10/25/2019,12,122
could add four or was we had five,10/25/2019,12,122
Grady's in the first and come away with,10/25/2019,12,122
nothing but what I liked about the game,10/25/2019,12,122
is we had a turnover they scored and but,10/25/2019,12,122
instead of getting crazy we just stayed,10/25/2019,12,122
with it stayed with it stayed with it we,10/25/2019,12,122
didn't give up much tonight which was,10/25/2019,12,122
positive and stayed the course I've got,10/25/2019,12,122
to break there at the end of the period,10/25/2019,12,122
and then just stay patient and the third,10/25/2019,12,122
two and you know a lot of times you look,10/25/2019,12,122
at scores after games you think team,10/25/2019,12,122
blue another team out it's 4-1 well,10/25/2019,12,122
you're at the game everyone gets their,10/25/2019,12,122
points everyone get just stay patient,10/25/2019,12,122
just do your thing you get an empty,10/25/2019,12,122
netter you get another one everything's,10/25/2019,12,122
good you get what you wanted points wise,10/25/2019,12,122
and then you get the score goal and get,10/25/2019,12,122
an assist as well so I thought it was a,10/25/2019,12,122
good lesson for us tonight and I thought,10/25/2019,12,122
our guys did a good job,10/25/2019,12,122
well we just didn't play as much in our,10/25/2019,12,122
own zone I mean you can't play in your,10/25/2019,12,122
own zone just I don't care how good you,10/25/2019,12,122
are in there you spent too much time in,10/25/2019,12,122
there you take penalties and you get,10/25/2019,12,122
worn out and I thought we're good line,10/25/2019,12,122
changes that we used everybody I thought,10/25/2019,12,122
our players were we're engaged now they,10/25/2019,12,122
played last night you know so it's,10/25/2019,12,122
different program for them too they won,10/25/2019,12,122
last night I thought they started real,10/25/2019,12,122
well we probably got better as the game,10/25/2019,12,122
went on I don't know if they did,10/25/2019,12,122
yeah I mean one thing about that we got,10/25/2019,12,122
lots of people and League to evaluate it,10/25/2019,12,122
so I don't need an opinion any worry,10/25/2019,12,122
about what he was playing I wouldn't,10/25/2019,12,122
know I couldn't understand why I believe,10/25/2019,12,122
and then when I saw the hit because I,10/25/2019,12,122
didn't see and I saw the hit in between,10/25/2019,12,122
periods and I said okay I guess that's,10/25/2019,12,122
why they made a believe,10/25/2019,12,122
seemed like a opposition here tonight,10/26/2019,13,190
they made your club pay for some,10/26/2019,13,190
mistakes yeah I mean I didn't think we,10/26/2019,13,190
were competitive enough in the first,10/26/2019,13,190
period we were really competitive got,10/26/2019,13,190
the game going in a second and then I,10/26/2019,13,190
mean we gave him three goals in the,10/26/2019,13,190
third any way you look at it we made,10/26/2019,13,190
mistakes and they just shot it in the,10/26/2019,13,190
net so we gifted them those three it's,10/26/2019,13,190
it's disappointing because we had,10/26/2019,13,190
crawled our way back and kind of set the,10/26/2019,13,190
tone unfortunate on the penalty kill 1,10/26/2019,13,190
they're obviously at the faceoff at,10/26/2019,13,190
center we thought we're in good position,10/26/2019,13,190
gonna have a puck and have a clear and,10/26/2019,13,190
next thing you know what's in our net I,10/26/2019,13,190
think they're alderman with the scariest,10/26/2019,13,190
thing about it I think if I could be,10/26/2019,13,190
wrong because I don't remember totally,10/26/2019,13,190
but I think and three of them were right,10/26/2019,13,190
there and going in the third period and,10/26/2019,13,190
don't get it done and so you know the,10/26/2019,13,190
bottom like I think the first one is a,10/26/2019,13,190
little different than the rest least no,10/26/2019,13,190
we played a lot of hockey you know that,10/26/2019,13,190
but I don't think you can talk about,10/26/2019,13,190
back-to-backs at this point in the,10/26/2019,13,190
season I think we the first weekend said,10/26/2019,13,190
everything right now you got to find,10/26/2019,13,190
ways to win these games well I didn't,10/26/2019,13,190
people soon the second period but it,10/26/2019,13,190
kept us in the first period like,10/26/2019,13,190
big-time in the first period and give us,10/26/2019,13,190
a chance and you know the ER thing is I,10/26/2019,13,190
mean obviously he's getting the starts,10/26/2019,13,190
on back-to-back so I thought we were set,10/26/2019,13,190
up to get him a win here tonight and,10/26/2019,13,190
it's unfortunate for him because I,10/26/2019,13,190
thought his effort wanted better from us,10/26/2019,13,190
well not the first obviously I mean you,10/26/2019,13,190
know that's it's a problem being good,10/26/2019,13,190
players is you draw the best matchup,10/26/2019,13,190
when you go in the opposition building,10/26/2019,13,190
and you got to be ready to go and that's,10/26/2019,13,190
just reality of the league that's how it,10/26/2019,13,190
is and we weren't as a group good enough,10/26/2019,13,190
in the first period watch I've been in,10/26/2019,13,190
faces on the back-to-back but what do,10/26/2019,13,190
you see as a coach what's the biggest,10/26/2019,13,190
challenge,10/26/2019,13,190
to losing the focus of your guy or is,10/26/2019,13,190
the physical aspect when the guys get,10/26/2019,13,190
tired,10/26/2019,13,190
is it the mental obviously obviously,10/26/2019,13,190
there's a reason and that teams aren't,10/26/2019,13,190
as good on back-to-back so obviously,10/26/2019,13,190
that's because you play but insane all,10/26/2019,13,190
that is to me,10/26/2019,13,190
is there on your schedule what are you,10/26/2019,13,190
gonna do about we just happen to be,10/26/2019,13,190
fortunate that we've had four in October,10/26/2019,13,190
that's great question but I haven't had,10/26/2019,13,190
one second we're just trying to win each,10/26/2019,13,190
night we're not worried about that,10/26/2019,13,190
obviously Tavares got to come back to,10/26/2019,13,190
but to me what it does it gives you an,10/26/2019,13,190
opportunity to see all these guys and,10/26/2019,13,190
these guys are getting great opportunity,10/26/2019,13,190
themselves so your rehearsals been,10/26/2019,13,190
longer than probably we expected and,10/26/2019,13,190
we're gonna have a way to make good,10/26/2019,13,190
decisions at the time when that happens,10/26/2019,13,190
to game work week coming up pretty good,10/26/2019,13,190
for you to work on some things and rest,10/26/2019,13,190
up in a way well obviously we haven't,10/26/2019,13,190
practiced at all and so that's a huge,10/26/2019,13,190
thing for us - if you don't / x you,10/26/2019,13,190
don't ski so we need to get out there,10/26/2019,13,190
and get Broxson but this will be a week,10/26/2019,13,190
that we get an opportunity and and get,10/26/2019,13,190
herself back on track we've got a big,10/26/2019,13,190
game again Washington and obviously it's,10/26/2019,13,190
important to get out of the month of,10/26/2019,13,190
October with the win,10/26/2019,13,190
I thought that part was good there was a,10/29/2019,14,275
lot of penalties wasn't there holy good,10/29/2019,14,275
there was a lot of felonies you know it,10/29/2019,14,275
was a hard game that way to play you sit,10/29/2019,14,275
there for a while because you penalty,10/29/2019,14,275
kill and then you're not getting out on,10/29/2019,14,275
that and you get out there and you get a,10/29/2019,14,275
good run then we have most Paul power,10/29/2019,14,275
plays and I thought both teams clogged,10/29/2019,14,275
it up real good I thought both teams,10/29/2019,14,275
made it hard it was hard to get the puck,10/29/2019,14,275
to Lynette I think partway through the,10/29/2019,14,275
game I looked up I thought there was,10/29/2019,14,275
like he was like each shots and stuff,10/29/2019,14,275
like that ORS not much going on but it,10/29/2019,14,275
was a competitive game we needed to win,10/29/2019,14,275
the game yeah find a way to win the game,10/29/2019,14,275
I thought we had got through when we got,10/29/2019,14,275
through the kill and then obviously we,10/29/2019,14,275
took another one there yeah on that high,10/29/2019,14,275
stick and it's unfortunate cuz I thought,10/29/2019,14,275
we'd done a real nice job in the PK he's,10/29/2019,14,275
not I mean he's injured but he's not,10/29/2019,14,275
really it's not his knee or nothing he's,10/29/2019,14,275
got a charley horse and so I don't know,10/29/2019,14,275
what that means though and I don't know,10/29/2019,14,275
timeline on that obviously you know what,10/29/2019,14,275
he's a good player for us important,10/29/2019,14,275
player for us but you know I thought all,10/29/2019,14,275
stepped up and played for a while Terry,10/29/2019,14,275
truth,10/29/2019,14,275
[Music],10/29/2019,14,275
well I don't know if he's wrong you know,10/29/2019,14,275
I think he would know he knows he lived,10/29/2019,14,275
it but I mean if you look at Steve,10/29/2019,14,275
Yzerman he lived it yeah a lot of guys,10/29/2019,14,275
love it they love it till they're 30 but,10/29/2019,14,275
you got to decide whether you want to,10/29/2019,14,275
wait till you're 30 or you want to,10/29/2019,14,275
figure it out now and it's the ultimate,10/29/2019,14,275
team game yeah and you gotta sacrifice,10/29/2019,14,275
individual rights for team rights and I,10/29/2019,14,275
say it all the time it's the two points,10/29/2019,14,275
in the game it has nothing to do with,10/29/2019,14,275
the points you get yourself but it's,10/29/2019,14,275
it's a process for a young guys and,10/29/2019,14,275
everybody in Toronto is in a rush all,10/29/2019,14,275
the time it you know I get it but that's,10/29/2019,14,275
not pro sport that's not real you got to,10/29/2019,14,275
keep building and building and building,10/29/2019,14,275
and steady on the rudder and keep going,10/29/2019,14,275
through things and matchups and learning,10/29/2019,14,275
to play with the lead and learning how,10/29/2019,14,275
to be patient and not turn the puck over,10/29/2019,14,275
and shift lengths and all the things,10/29/2019,14,275
that you're just a good player and you,10/29/2019,14,275
haven't had to deal with well you got to,10/29/2019,14,275
deal with the want to win in the,10/29/2019,14,275
National Hockey League and I mean look,10/29/2019,14,275
at the age of st. Louis you know well,10/29/2019,14,275
that's just the reality of the situation,10/29/2019,14,275
but the one thing about it is it gets,10/29/2019,14,275
your attention hurts your feelings,10/29/2019,14,275
probably a little bit,10/29/2019,14,275
well he knows he lived it he was the guy,10/29/2019,14,275
you know and then figured out this is,10/29/2019,14,275
what we got to do to win so you I mean,10/29/2019,14,275
that's why when he sees us you know we,10/29/2019,14,275
talked about this last year of fun to,10/29/2019,14,275
watch going 100 miles an hour gotta,10/29/2019,14,275
learn how to play right just just,10/29/2019,14,275
talking about running and gunning and,10/29/2019,14,275
not being able to play make the bottom,10/29/2019,14,275
line you got to keep it out of your net,10/29/2019,14,275
you're not out scoring anybody up,10/29/2019,14,275
playoff time you got out defend them and,10/29/2019,14,275
then it your skill comes to the,10/29/2019,14,275
forefront and and so that's what he's,10/29/2019,14,275
talking about and but is that not a fair,10/29/2019,14,275
assessment you know it hurts my feelings,10/29/2019,14,275
I could tell you that I'm the coach I'm,10/29/2019,14,275
supposed to get all this organized so,10/29/2019,14,275
but we know this we were working the,10/29/2019,14,275
words that everyday we're talking about,10/29/2019,14,275
it every single day just because you're,10/29/2019,14,275
talking about it it doesn't mean it's,10/29/2019,14,275
gonna change right away and sometimes,10/29/2019,14,275
it's just life lessons but in saying all,10/29/2019,14,275
that is we think we're on the right,10/29/2019,14,275
process we think we got good people and,10/29/2019,14,275
we're going in the right direction well,10/29/2019,14,275
you know what's played there in Plymouth,10/29/2019,14,275
and I saw him Lots as a junior when they,10/29/2019,14,275
first got him really NHL I thought of,10/29/2019,14,275
all the reqtest kid they got him here,10/29/2019,14,275
too soon and he's turned himself because,10/29/2019,14,275
he can play with good players he's a,10/29/2019,14,275
good talent he's mean he's heard he's,10/29/2019,14,275
physical he's a factor and but he can,10/29/2019,14,275
play in your top sex not many guys like,10/29/2019,14,275
that,10/29/2019,14,275
I thought we started really good I,11/1/2019,15,40
thought when we took the three penalties,11/1/2019,15,40
in a row we got off kilter and got on,11/1/2019,15,40
her heels and I didn't think we really,11/1/2019,15,40
did we lost with you got her game back,11/1/2019,15,40
yeah and so to me you got to play longer,11/1/2019,15,40
and harder than the other team and we,11/1/2019,15,40
were unable to do that we got ourselves,11/1/2019,15,40
a win and so we feel good about the win,11/1/2019,15,40
we're set up with a good week here this,11/1/2019,15,40
week we got to take some steps and the,11/1/2019,15,40
guys know that and I know that we had to,11/1/2019,15,40
do a better job was there was her best,11/1/2019,15,40
player right you know and so he was,11/1/2019,15,40
flying,11/1/2019,15,40
obviously he had some history here,11/1/2019,15,40
wanted to make an impression was good I,11/1/2019,15,40
mean we had him on multiple lines,11/1/2019,15,40
I thought he played well yeah I mean,11/1/2019,15,40
